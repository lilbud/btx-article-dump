It was the gold coast of rock. Now a new film featuring the Boss tells the town's great story

It's hard to cross the street in Asbury Park, New Jersey, without tripping over a gem of rock history. The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the Who played some of their earliest US concerts here. So did the Doors, Black Sabbath and the Clash. Most famously, it was the down-at-heel beach town that inspired Bruce Springsteen's early music. He still lives on a ranch spitting distance away, and you can sometimes see him strolling on the boardwalk, baseball cap pulled low.

The strip of cafes, restaurants and beachfront homes that runs from Long Branch to Manasquan is arguably to rock what Nashville is to country music and New Orleans is to jazz. How it earned its reputation is explained in a new documentary, Asbury Park: Riot, Redemption, Rock 'n Roll.

The story begins in the 1960s, when Asbury Park became a melting pot. On the west side of its railway tracks were bars and clubs frequented by African- American musicians. On the east side were the upmarket hotels and ballrooms for New Yorkers who came to escape the traffic and summer heat. Jazz, soul and pop fused into what later became known as the New Jersey sound. It helped give birth to the music of Gary US Bonds, Southside Johnny and Joe Grushecky. Jon Bon Jovi played here when he was still performing as John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones, while the Ramones, the Runaways and George Thorogood and the Destroyers all honed their style in Asbury Park.

The town's reputation attracted the attention of Moe Septee, a Broadway producer, who in 1964 took over concert promotions at Asbury Park Convention Hall, a magnificent beachside theatre. In the next decade, he booked the Beach Boys, James Brown, the Byrds, Ray Charles, Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, the Temptations and Pink Floyd.

Visitors from the Big Apple and further afield crowded into Asbury Park for the concerts, then radiated out into the town's honky-tonk joints and nightspots to hear local acts. In 1968 there were 73 clubs, bars and ballrooms playing live music, all in the space of a square mile. Many were located on one street — Springwood Avenue — whose venues were razed to the ground in ugly race riots just as they became a symbol for interracial harmony

The film tells the story through interviews with the musicians who created the Jersey sound and lived through the riots. "Asbury Park is an American Liverpool... Its story of tragedy and poetry and promise matters to everyone, not just people from New Jersey or Americans", says Tom Jones, the film's writer and director.

Its star is Springsteen, whose career began in a tiny club called the Upstage, a sort of mirror image of the Cavern Club, being at the top of two flights of stairs instead of underground. The fact that it had no liquor licence worked in its favour; it became a mecca for the under-18s and a place where up-and- coming musicians — black and white — could show off their talents.

"I came here [to the Upstage] by myself", Springsteen recalls in the film. "I brought my guitar, made my way up the stairs [and] played Rock Me, Baby, Jeff Beck-style, with everything I had, setting off all the fireworks I could."

At one point, Springsteen's fledgling band had three black and three white musicians, a racial balance almost unheard of at that time. "Springwood Avenue was a huge centre of African-American culture", he says. "You went to the Orchid Lounge. It was a black club, but you could be white and go there, and it wasn't any problem. They played a lot of jazz, but they also had soul entertainers come in.

"Unlike Dylan or the Beatles, who I believe were musical revolutionaries, we were more alchemists. We took a little bit from here, a little bit from there, a little bit from soul, a little bit from pop, a little bit from the sound on the west side of the tracks, you know, and we kind of combined it all into the sound that this little part of the Jersey Shore became known for."

The cast of drunks, drifters and deadbeats — or, viewed from another angle, saints, angels and martyrs — inspired Springsteen's Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ, whose ballads captured the grandeur of American working life.

"The songs were culled from characters both real and imagined from the streets of Asbury Park", he says. "The carney [carnival] atmosphere, the street atmosphere, the sort of punk poetry... it was just a part of the town at that moment, so that was how I translated it. [One day] I passed the postcard stand and I went, 'Hmm, I like this. This is me, you know? This is where I'm from.'"

When I talked to Springsteen last year, I had asked if it was a more innocent time. "Towns were very tight-knit, because much more of your life was concentrated in a smaller area, so your world was your neighbourhood. From this vantage point, yes, it was a more innocent time. But it was filled with a tremendous amount of bigotry."

Just as Asbury Park was being taken seriously for its music, the melting pot boiled over. On July 4 — Independence Day — 1970, rioting and looting took hold. "The city was tense, and eventually it exploded", Springsteen says. "I was living in the surfboard factory, climbed on top of the water tower, and the clouds billowed off the shore for days. It was a sad moment in the city's history, but it probably needed to happen." Springfield Avenue was torched and the town entered a spiral of decline. The Upstage closed in 1971 and an era of great music was over. Springsteen wrote one of his best songs, 4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy), to sum up the exodus, which states: "For me this boardwalk life is through."

"You forget, when Springwood Avenue burnt, the tremendous loss of African- American culture in the city, and that's never quite come back the way it was at one time", he says today. "[But] you have to proceed as if problems can be resolved, and as if the sun's going to rise in the morning, and those better days are awaiting."

Asbury Park's efforts to re-establish itself as a centre of musical talent ended with the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. But, according to the film, there are at last glimmers of hope. Money from the government's emergency fund has breathed new life into the area. Shops that were boarded up long before the storm are reopening; boardwalks and piers that closed are back in vogue.

As summer visitors return, a new scene is developing. "It got so low, it was like an open space, an open city", Springsteen says. "The gay population came down and began to be real creative. Had some musicians, some artists come in, and it was a place where suddenly there was room to create."

Where there were ruins, there are now brightly painted beach bars and pastel houses. Seafront Victorian homes are being restored. The danger as the developers move in is that the ruins housing what is effectively the biggest open-air rock museum in the world will be bulldozed. See it now, before it's gone.
