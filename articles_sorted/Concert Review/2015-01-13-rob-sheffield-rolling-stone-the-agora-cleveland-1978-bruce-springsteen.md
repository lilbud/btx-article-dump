Bruce's greatest official bootleg ever is full of fire and verve

Imagine hearing Springsteen go from "Racing in the Street" into "Thunder Road" into "Jungleland" – and then he comes back out for the second half of the show. This epic Cleveland set is from August 9th, 1978, a highlight of the fabled Darkness tour, simulcast on local station WMMS. Springsteen burns through classics like "Rosalita" (with a snippet of the Village People's "Macho Man"), castoff gems like "Fire" and covers from "Summertime Blues" to "Twist and Shout." The peak is the 10-minute "Prove It All Night", with the long, moody guitar-piano intro. This is simply the greatest live LP this greatest of live rockers has ever officially released.
