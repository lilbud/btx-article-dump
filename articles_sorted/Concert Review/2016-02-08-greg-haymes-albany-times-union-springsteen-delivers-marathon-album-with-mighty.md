Rolling into the Times Union Center on Monday night in support of their mammoth "The Ties That Bind: The River Collection", a whopping seven-disc comprehensive look at the era of the 1980 double-album, "The River", Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band took the stage at 8 p.m. and steamrolled through a 3½ hour set of 34 songs. It was an exhausting, Herculean effort, both for the band and for the sold-out, jam-packed crowd.

It was also richly rewarding, as the first two hours featured a song-by-song performance of "The River", followed by a 90-minute tear through a cherry- picked selection of greatest hits that included "Badlands", "Backstreets""Thunder Road", "Born to Run", an electrifying "Rosalita" and more.

"Are you ready to be entertained?" he asked the crowd at the start of the show. "Are you ready to be transformed?

"Come along with us as we go down to the river..."

With a pared-back, eight-piece band behind him (minus the horn section and back-up singers that accompanied him at his last stop at the downtown arena in May of 2014), the 66-year-old Springsteen explained that "The River" was "my coming of age record." Of course, he and the boys (and guitarist-violinist Soozie Tyrell) can still kick the stuffing out of the arena-ready party anthems – "I'm a Rocker", "Crush On You" and the Coasters-esque "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)." And soul-strolls like "Fade Away" and "I Wanna Marry You" (which he described as "a young man's song, a daydream") still tugged at the heart.

But it was the back-to-back pairing of the album's title song (with Tyrell on violin, Nils Lofgren on steel guitar and the Boss' consigliere Steve Van Zandt on 12-string guitar) with "Point Blank" that cut the deepest, not only brimming over with narrative drama, but resonating the most from the perspective of age?

Despite the four-guitar army up front, "Because the Night" was driven by Roy Bittan at his white Yamaha grand piano – at least until Lofgren uncorked the best guitar solo of the night. And saxman Jake Clemmons played with impressive confidence and power throughout the evening, swooping in on his solos like a hawk.

By the time Springsteen & Co. wrapped things up with a joyous, unbridled stomp through the Isley Brothers.
