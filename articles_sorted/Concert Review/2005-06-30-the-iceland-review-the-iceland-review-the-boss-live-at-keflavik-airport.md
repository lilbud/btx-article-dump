Employees working the Tuesday night shift at Keflavík Airport got an unexpected visit from the savior of Rock & Roll, Bruce Springsteen. According to Fréttablaðið, the singer and songwriter's private jet stopped over on its way to the US from Berlin where Springsteen had been playing on the 28th of June. During the month of June, Springsteen has been touring Europe with his acoustic guitar promoting his first record in three years, Devils and Dust.

Springsteen was headed back to the United States after playing a show in Berlin when his plane stopped early Wednesday to refuel at Keflavik International Airport.

"He just came in and did some songs", said Federick Johnson, a service manager at the airport 30 miles southwest of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik.

The 2 a.m. mini-set reportedly included Springsteen staples "Dancing in the Dark", "Bobby Jean" and "This Hard Land", along with "Working on the Highway", "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" and "I'm on Fire."

The employees commented that Springsteen showed no pretense and was very down- to-earth, chatting away with them. His friend asked the airport employees if they would like to listen to a few tunes. After the impromptu concert he asked what typical Icelandic food consisted of - the fans were quick to answer "Black Death and Shark"
