Bruce Springsteen is 64 years old. Sixty-four. As in "Will you still need me?

Will you still feed me?"

To his everlasting credit, he refuses to act his age, as evidenced by the joyful 28-song, 3-hour and 8-minute show he put on at the Farm Bureau Live amphitheater in Virginia Beach on Saturday night. He spent much of the night scrambling around the stage like an 8-year-old on a sugar rush.

Springsteen danced. He crowd-surfed. He dropped to the floor and spun in circles like Curly from the "Three Stooges." He proudly guzzled an entire $14 beer handed to him from the crowd – motioning sax player Jake Clemons to keep playing while The Boss knocked down the beer in one extended swallow. Near the end of the show, he giddily laid his head on the piano keyboard and allowed Roy Bittan to hit the treble notes by bopping Springsteen's temple on the keys.

It marked the first time in Springsteen's legendary career that he played Virginia Beach, and he set the tone from the start. "We got some beach music for you!" he shouted, before opening the set with "May I", a hit for Hampton Roads' own Bill Deal and the Rhondels back in 1969. The five-piece horn section, highlighted in the arrangements all night, made that glorious chestnut (originally recorded by Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs in 1962) feel perfectly contemporary.

The E-Street Band was playing its first gig since getting inducted en masse into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Thursday night. Astonishingly, it was also the band's first visit to the Hampton Roads region in 28 freakin' years.

The band somehow manages to get tighter in its arrangements and simultaneously looser in its stage antics with each passing year. While Springsteen sang the anthem "Badlands", drummer Max Weinberg neatly punctuated the words "faith"

and "hope" and "love" with cymbal clashes.

On this tour, Tom Morello – the pyrotechnic guitarist from Rage Against the Machine – is standing in for longtime Springsteen cohort Little Steven Van Zandt, who is busy with a TV project. Morello played a key role in several songs on Springsteen's 2013 CD "High Hopes", and on Saturday night he did a good job of integrating his show-stopping solos seamlessly into the band's arrangements. In Morello and Nils Lofgren, Springsteen has two of the most creative and limber lead guitarists in all of rock and roll, and both had their chances to shine – Lofgren spinning like a top while performing a finger-tapping lick during "Because the Night", and Morello bringing the house down with a screechy, scratchy coda to "The Ghost of Tom Joad."

One of the highlights of the show was "Talk to Me", requested by a handwritten cardboard sign in the pit. The song, which Springsteen wrote in the late 1970s and gave to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, is about a poor sap desperately trying to figure out why the love of his life is hanging out with some other guy but won't even speak to him anymore. On Saturday night, Springsteen turned it into a hilarious vamp with his wife, E-Streeter Patti Scialfa. "I'd rather dodge flying blow dryers than get the silent treatment!"

he crowed. Over and over he pleaded for a word, a phrase, anything ... until Scialfa sweetly cooed back at him, "Talk to me ... until the night is over!" As she repeated the song's chorus, Springsteen kept assuring her, "I am talking to you! This is what I sound like when I talk!"

Taking the stage for his encore, Springsteen reminded the crowd of his long history in Virginia. "Back when New Jersey was the only place where we could get paid", he said, "there was one other place. We could come down to Richmond and make enough money to keep us going."

After starting the encore with "The Wall", a melancholy ode to friends who died in Vietnam, he kicked into high gear with "Born to Run" and a rollicking cover of "Seven Nights to Rock." On "Dancing in the Dark", he pulled a man, a woman and a young girl out of the crowd and not only danced with them, but thrust guitars into their hands and urged them to play along with him at center stage. "Tenth Avenue Freeze-out" included a video tribute to the two band members who have died in recent years – keyboardist Danny Federici and Norfolk-born sax man Clarence "The Big Man" Clemons. The band was ready to call it a night after a marathon rave-up on "Shout", but Springsteen called them back out for one more anthem – the timeless "Thunder Road."

For Springsteen, who spent much of his adolescence surfing on the Jersey Shore, it was a night of beach music. For the full house that packed the amphitheater, it was a happy reminder that it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive.
