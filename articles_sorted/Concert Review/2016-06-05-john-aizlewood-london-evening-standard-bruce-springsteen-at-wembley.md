The 66-year-old somehow managed to turn Wembley's vast prairies into a warm, almost personal cocoon, with undercurrents of rock-encrusted spiritual fervour, says John Aizlewood

"What a night", gushed Bruce Springsteen by way of introduction to his first Wembley Stadium concert since 2013. In fact, it was barely 6.30pm, but since he had a three-and-a-half-hour show to get through and a 10pm curfew to honour, there was little time to waste.

There was voodoo afoot. Wisely, he has never troubled himself with attempting to re-invent the wheel, so what he does is no mystery — knowing how he does it certainly is.

For all the opportunities for smoke and mirrors that stadium rock offers, some things cannot be faked. For those three-and-a-half, interval-free hours, the 66-year-old Springsteen refused to yield to time.

He gambolled across Wembley with more energy than its previous headliners, England's football team; he launched himself into the audience; he downed a fan's pint of lager in one during Spirit In The Night; he dedicated the mournful Tougher Than The Rest to Muhammad Ali before crooning it alongside his wife, Patti Scialfa, and he allowed an impressively voiced little girl to almost steal the show by singing a chorus to Waitin' On A Sunny Day. "London's Got Talent", he quipped afterwards.

The sound wasn't always pristine, but Springsteen somehow managed to turn Wembley's vast prairies into a warm, almost personal cocoon, with undercurrents of rock-encrusted spiritual fervour.

The River tour was named to promote last year's box set expansion of that 1980 album and the American dates saw him playing the whole thing, in order. Last night, before an audience including Prince Harry, politician George Galloway, Matt LeBlanc and Simon Mayo, Springsteen was less rigid.

He dipped into The River, played a selection of standards (Born To Run sizzled, The Rising rose, Badlands thundered) and a few unlikely, diehard- delighting offcuts such as the rarely played I'll Work For Your Love.

Whether rocking out on Sherry Darling and a startlingly intense Because The Night, unfurling heartbreaking tales of thwarted lives on The River's desperately moving title track or enticing 70,000 people to sing along with the refrain "You can get killed just for living in your American skin" on the fiercely political American Skin (41 Shots), Springsteen was the consummate, gimmick-free showman.

Yet again he emerged as a great American troubadour relying only on himself, 33 of his songs and the tightly drilled E Street Band, instinctively attuned to every twist and turn on their leader's highway. A marathon which felt like a sprint.
