I just came from Chile, after a 1 day trip to Santiago, without sleeping, and having to go to work in 2 hours. I couldn´t wait to write about the show. Me and a fellow fan arrived about 5.00 pm and there were lots of places, we found a good spot in front but in the right, like in Stevie´s side. We met lots of Latin American fans, all very excited and amazed, not believing we were going to see Bruce. Thousands of sacrified stories, few Bruce shows on our back most of us and finding new friends amongst Bruce. I met Frank, a greasy laker too, from Germany!

Bruce enters and we all started to shout and jump and scream. Me crying, the guy beside me too, other one screaming, others holding, it was amazing!

You surely know the setlist by now, started with We take care of our own, and gave us a nice setlist, we don´t complain about setlists yet, we are in another stage, jajaja. Think about us, we have few or no shows before, and a bit of everything was amazing! Years of listening those songs all alone, and finally listening to them in our lands!!!! how can that be boring???

The highlights of the show: for me The River, I couldn't stop crying, never heard it live before, amazing! Bruce said he was amazed we knew his songs, and that we were very enthusiastic! He was amazing, always laughing, moving, offering a great show. Othe great great songs Johnny 99 and acoustic This hard land, AMAZINGLY beautiful!!

The political moment: He sang a Victor Jara song called Manifiesto in spanishhhh, remembering the musician who was killed by the military government in Chile, and Bruce remembered his participation in Amnesty, and that they were not able to play in Chile. He has a great pronunciation!

The funny moments: he invited like 4 or 5 girls to dance Dancing in the dark with him, even a guy, and a pregnant girl, to whom he gave a guitar and she sang and played with them, amazingggggggg. One of them robbed him a big kiss like in the 70`s!!! He even got kind of lost during Spirit in the Night, it reminded me to the Hammersmith show. Bruce even kissed in the lips to a girl during "me and crazy janey were making love in the dirt"... imagine that!

The E Street Band: Obviously the best band in the world but they seemed (specially Steve and Garry) like a bit tired. Steve didn`t much pay attention to us, who watched us a lot, we tried to call his attention a lot, but with few results. Everyone know why this might be? Garry laughed a bit, he was nice. No Patti.

He played 3.30 hs, our body was acking, we were VERY tired but inmensly happy about the possibility. I touched his hand, his arm, I cried, laughed, jumped, everything I could to express my happiness. It was a great show I will never forget. The best one, will be tomorrow, in my country, we will make sure he never forgets us!
