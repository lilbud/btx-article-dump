HARTFORD – Are you ready for transformation?

That is the question Bruce Springsteen often asks of those who embark on a journey with the E Street Band. He asked the sold out crowd at the XL Center on Wednesday night.

The crowd roared a hoarse approval, and the artist delivered.

The journey this time out, more than 40 years into his touring career, is a retrospective of "The River", Springsteen's acclaimed 1980 double-album that was recently re-released as a box set with remastered cuts, lost tracks, and concert footage.

Springsteen's stripped-down version of the E Street Band, an eight-piece outfit that eschewed the gospel choir, horn section, added guitar and vocals (Tom Morello is not on the tour and Patti Scialfa was missing from the lineup) served as guides on the journey, a three hour and 16-minute, 33-song affair that began with a reading of "The River" in the exact order it was laid out on vinyl.

"This was my coming of age record", said Springsteen. "I wanted it to be big.

I wanted it to feel like life."

The band took the stage with the lights on as if they had just happened upon this setting and fired into "Meet Me In The City", an outtake from "The River"

sessions which has been re-imagined as the lead single.

The record came to life through "The Ties That Bind", and "Sherry Darling"two songs of jubilation tempered with life's adult questions about commitment and accountability. "Independence Day" was the first song Springsteen wrote "about fathers and sons" and came off as simultaneously sad and grand.

The sequencing of the album (does that even happen anymore?) shines in a live setting as the story escalates and the characters evolve. Jubilation returned, this time underscored with restlessness on "Out in the Street."

Reaching transformation is never easy in a room with 15,000 strangers and to make the task even more challenging Springsteen was sticking to a script.

There are songs on "The River" that were never meant to be played in an arena concert ("I Wanna Marry You") and songs ("I'm A Rocker") that were probably never meant to be played again.

However, the hidden gems on the recording like "Point Blank", and "Stolen Car"

were both beautifully rendered and moved the transformation process along quite well.

It was a coming out party of sorts for Jake Clemons, nephew of the late Clarence Clemons who has filled the void on saxophone for several tours now.

"The River" is a showcase record for the saxophone and Clemons' shone brightly in his expanded role on songs like "Drive All Night."

The night had pockets of exuberance with Springsteen crowd-surfing through "Hungry Heart" and guitars ringing out on "Cadillac Ranch", "Ramrod", and "Crush on You."

The journey closed with the somber "Wreck on the Highway."

Taking only enough time to switch guitars, Springsteen lit into the second act, this time paying tribute to his 1984 release "Born on the USA" with "No Surrender", "Bobby Jean", and "Dancing in the Dark" all making the list.

He pulled out "Loose End" a track left off "The River" that fit perfectly with the album's overall theme. The band veered from "Because the Night" to "The Rising" and "Thunder Road", before a lights-on-again encore of "Born to Run."

The staple "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" was a bar-band mess complete with a Three Stooges (Clemons, Springsteen, Little Steven) mash-up at the center microphone. The night ended with a cover of "Shout."
