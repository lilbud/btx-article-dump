WHEN THEY were good they were very very good, and when they were bad they were so-so.

There was an immense feeling of strain about this show, following a press and publicity campaign of unparallelled intensity. With slogans as pompous as 'Finally...the world is ready for Bruce Springsteen' splattered all over town, the poor geezer, unless he has an ego twice the size of the Post Office Tower, must have walked onstage with a barrel of monkeys on his back.

It didn't come over like that. Whole chunks of the show were pure delight – after the dramatic first sighting of the long-awaited Messiah of rock 'n' roll bathed in a shaft of green light, head bowed, in stark silhouette, as he intoned 'Meeting Across The River' amidst the unwonted sound of silence.

Yes, the clamorous audience hushed up when their hero came on-stage, one of the biggest marks of respect you can get. One of the only musicians I've ever seen receive this tribute is wonderful Mike Nesmith.

The show started off with Springsteen, a tiny figure thrashing about with the physical exhuberance that made his music more exciting live than on vinyl, through 'Thunder Road' and 'Tenth Avenue Freeze Out'. So it carried on for the next hour, the general pattern being that the fast ones were better than the slow ones. The reason for this seemed to be that Springsteen very much values proximity with his audience, being used to the club context in the States, and attempting to strike up a rapport when you're separated by yards from a completely unfamiliar audience isn't the kind of two-way communication he's used to instigating.

Gags like tumbling into the laps of the front row of the audience, for example, are completely out unless you feel like breaking your back. Seemingly discouraged, Bruce held back from the sprightly monologues introducing and explaining each song that we'd come to expect as one of the main charms of Springsteen Live.

Anyway, 'Worse Than The Flood', and 'She's The One', especially the latter, were excellent, with much more attack than the album versions. At this stage of the game, Springsteen looked as if he was having an infectiously nice time, and Clarence Clemens was letting fly with some apt sax, not earth-shattering but suitable.

They're very funky together but come apart at the seams somewhat when called upon to do solos – the biggest mistake of the evening was the lukewarm bunch of individual efforts on 'Kitty's Back'. The organ solo stank (Danny Federici), but the piano was a little better. Clarence on sax came out of it best, Brucie wasn't extra-special and the drummer was pretty good.

I think it was about that time that the old attention began to flag, and when you find yourself watching the clock during the premier by the Great White Hope of rock 'n' roll, something's wrong somewhere.

It seemed like the real trouble was that someone had warned Bruce to get out there and not let up for 2 hours, play nothing but his own material when he usually sprinkles the set with oldies, and the burden of being ordered to take London by storm proved too much for his slender shoulders. He shoulda done a week at Ronnie's. I'd have liked a good bop.
