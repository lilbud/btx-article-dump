PROVIDENCE -- If you hoped Bruce Springsteen might lighten up after last winter's serious, grim-faced shows at Boston's Orpheum Theatre, then you got your wish last night. Springsteen still delved into the stark, John Steinbeck- informed story lines of his working-class "Ghost of Tom Joad" album, but he leavened this better-rounded, more personable show with needed comic relief.

Springsteen, still playing in a solo acoustic format, unveiled two, newly written songs that were hysterical parodies of tabloid culture and late-night TV. The song "Sell It" poked fun at the infomercials of Dionne Warwick and Cher, levied a shot at Evil Knievel ("I thought he was dead") and seemed a belly-laughing sequel to Springsteen's earlier TV satire, "57 Channels (And Nothin' On)."

The humor continued with a song played for the first time last night (and penned just yesterday afternoon). "There Will Never Be" swiped at tabloid sensationalism and the opening lines had the crowd roaring: "Princess Di may find another man/ Prince Charles may want to live in another's woman's underpants." That's a long way from Tom Joad, for sure. The tune went on to goof on Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis and Priscilla Presley, Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye ...and you get the idea.

A lighter-of-heart Springsteen, playing nine or 10 different songs than at the Orpheum show I caught, got silly again with his little-performed "Red Headed Woman", described as "one of the greatest songs ever about cunnilingus. But I don't know what the other contenders might be."

It was good to see Springsteen smiling more, talking more and dealing with what he afterwards called "life's absurdities." But he also noted correctly that the show, humor aside, built "to the quieter moments." These came on "Across the Border" (with its high-lonesome wail), "Galveston Bay" (about discrimination toward Vietnamese fishermen in Texas) and a radically revised version of "Promised Land", accompanied by percussive tapping of his guitar, rather than the full chords of the version he closed his second Orpheum show with.

To provide further balance in this constantly evolving solo show, Springsteen played more 12-string guitar (keying a stunningly dramatic "Darkness on the Edge of Town") and added some older catalog chestnuts such as "Point Blank" and the playful, love-affirming "Bobbie Jean."

More talkative this time, Springsteen shared philosophical musings ("Adulthood can feel like a constant battle against cynicism"), insights on children ("They're a window into the graces of the world"), memories of a Mexican friend he played cards with during a motorcycle trip through Arizona, together with memories of his own childhood ("there wasn't much art or culture in the house, everyone was just trying to keep their head above water") and dialogue quotes from John Ford's movie of "The Grapes of Wrath."

It was all-purposed entertainment that made its underdog points clearly, but was delivered with a welcome, lighter touch that reflected more of Springsteen's true personality, not just his politics.
