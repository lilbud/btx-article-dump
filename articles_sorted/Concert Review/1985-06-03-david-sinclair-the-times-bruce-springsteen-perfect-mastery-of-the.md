Bruce Springsteen: Slane Castle, Dublin

"HE DOESN'T WEAR his money on his back", commented the Irish cabby, referring to the renowned lack of ostentation of Bruce Springsteen, the man responsible for the first of the season's major outdoor events, a vast gathering on a cloudless summer day on the banks of the River Boyne.

The rustic charm of the setting belied the good-natured pandemonium which prevailed in some parts of the enormous audience, estimated at 100,000. Although there was a cool breeze, stewards continually sprayed water from hosepipes over the sweating bodies crammed in a dark mass at the front. A steady stream of casualties were hauled out of the crowd and lifted away on stretchers (forty heat victims, two crushed and two appendix cases were reported), while some of the more adventurous non-ticket holders attempted to swim or wade across the river to gain access behind the stage.

Huge Diamond Vision monitor screens, positioned by the stage, relayed close-up images of the musicians that were a good half second out of sync with the sound as it struggled to catch up with the sound over the distance to the back.

Springsteen's ability to communicate to such a large gathering was impressive, and the visible surges of excitement which greeted the start of practically every song bore witness both to the cohesion of the band and his strength as a song-writer and performer. Some of the numbers were prefaced by long, articulate introductions, and in 'Pink Cadillac', a fire-and-brimstone rap concerning the balancing of material greed again spiritual wellbeing, made excellent rock 'n' roll listening while turning in a sharp philosophical point.

The poignant melodies of 'I'm On Fire' and 'The River' contrasted with the bombastic melodrama of 'Born to Run' and 'Rosalita'. But as ever, the core of Springsteen's live appeal was his perfect mastery of the rock 'n' roll dance beat. Like the Rolling Stones, to whom he owes a small debt, he played songs which absolutely commanded the audience to dance: 'Born in the USA' and 'Dancing in the Dark', to name but two, sent the cheers of a multitude echoing round the verdant Irish countryside.
