CLEVELAND, Ohio – Bruce Springsteen and the guys (and gal) in the E Street Band must mainline energy drinks. There's no other way they could maintain the level of enthusiasm that rocked Quicken Loans Arena for more than three hours Tuesday night.

You gotta figure Joe Kearney and Paul Lamb got their money's worth. Of course, so did the other 19,000-plus who sold out The Q. But they didn't come from Belfast, Northern Ireland.

That's right, Lamb laid out the euros for the airfare and tickets as a 60th birthday gift for his Uncle Joe to see the Boss & Co.

Again.

Kearney has seen Springsteen and his band seven or eight times, and his nephew 12 or 13, all in Ireland. The show in America gave them a bit of a different look.

"We flew in from Belfast on Saturday and fly back Friday", Kearney said in the lilting Irish accent so different from the Hollywood brogue stereotype.

Now to be fair, they made their first trip to Cleveland because Springsteen's New York City show at Madison Square Garden was sold out, but neither man was complaining.

"It's been great", Kearney said, in a brogue so thick that it sounded like "grit." "Everyone's been so friendly and the food is really good."

So are the bars, said the two, who admitted sampling a Cleveland version of a pub or two during their stay. Hey, some stereotypes have their basis in fact.

For the Irish kinsmen, a Springsteen show is old hat, even if it was in a different setting. For 8-year-old Willow Aubry, it was a first. The Falls- Lenox second grader was at The Q with mom and dad, Tom and Terri.

Shy and sweet, with blue eyes the color of a Caribbean sea, she nonetheless knew her Boss. Maybe that's because her Canadian-born dad has seen Springsteen as many as 15 times, and plays the albums all the time. How else would a sprite like that – clutching her first-ever concert T-shirt – say that her favorite Bruce song was a somewhat obscure recording of "The Erie Canal" and explain to her classmates just WHO she was going to see Tuesday night?

She might want to hold onto that T-shirt for posterity, too. With prices that ranged from $40 for a regular T-shirt to $65 for a hoodie and even $15 for a simple coffee cup, it can only go up in value.

Because of deadlines, I wasn't able to see the entire show, much to my chagrin, even if Springsteen did have a bit of a mind-slip, referring to Cleveland as Pittsburgh before catching his error.

Anyone else, that would've been justification for the Spanish Inquisition. Not Springsteen. He has owned this city since his first show here in 1974, and if Tuesday's show is any indicator, there's not a chance in the world of him losing the deed.

The tour celebrates the 1980 release of his first "grown-up" album, "The River", with tunes like the rollicking "Sherry Darling" and "Hungry Heart"

(you haven't lived till you've seen a 66-year-old Springsteen crowd-surfing the pit during the latter song) and the wrenching "Independence Day."

The last, written about a conversation with his father, was one of the first works in Springsteen's vast, poetic catalog that examines mortality and reality. While it's a realization that parents didn't come into the world devoid of dreams, it also is a desperate vow that we won't be like them, even knowing that vow is an exercise in futility.

And that's the beauty of Springsteen's work. Yeah, he can rock all night long, belting that trademark rasp, accompanied by Little Steven Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, Soozie Tyrell, Max Weinberg, Roy Bittan, Gary Tallent and an almost frighteningly good Jake Clemons, nephew of the late Clarence Clemons.

But in the end, he's a mashup of Faulkner, Shakespeare and Freud with a Telecaster.
