A new archival series of concert recordings aims to rectify live albums long overlooked by a casual audience. One of the first to garner attention, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: The Agora Cleveland 1978, is a remastered set selected from a legendary tour rightly cherished by hardcore followers.

Superlatives aside, this is a historic performance, not the least due to the clubby "you are there" quality that comes across in its hearing even today.

Frequently bootlegged for years, the date is part of a holy trinity of bang-up Cleveland moment, the first being Alan Freed's "Moondog Corporation Ball", universally recognized as the world's first rock 'n' roll concert, with the second being the infamous "Beer Night" riot at the old Municipal Stadium, where Texas Rangers manager Billy Martin grabbed a fungo bat and went mano-a- mano against a few thousand fractious Tribe fans. Conceived as an exultant one-off, Springsteen's appearance at Hank LoConti's legendary venue uncannily reflected the attitude of the city at that specific juncture, before working- class aspirations went completely to shit and the Disneyfication of the post- industrial landscape commenced apace. No private party: No Bobby, no Jack, no Marty, no Warren in the house, no one but a fervent crowd of unruly blue- collar fans packed into a local bar with a blistering group headlining.

The cymbal splash and cracking snare, the tambourine, and the chugging slapback riff of "Summertime Blues" announced the just intentions of an act enamored of their calling, with nothing to lose and mercilessly willing to prove it. The band and its audience were nearly out of control by the encores—"Willoughby sucks!". The original radio broadcast was three hours of sweat and muscle and thunder and lightning, utter delirium going out over the airwaves to three million souls, thanks to the Kid and WMMS. While not exactly a dangerous gig, the potential for chaos among what was then still Springsteen's familiar cohort is what distinguishes this performance as unique.

That August evening on the cusp of autumn was when the artist sensed all wasn't right with the Republic, and the wheels began coming off his imagination of the American carnivalesque, with those present sharing in his desperation and his fury. The fourth wall seriously buckled, as with punk, yet there was a magic in that night that made this show special. One doesn't just hear it. Given a close listen, it can actually be felt, not just in the music, but also in its reception.

What exactly is that "it"? Can't say for sure, but The Agora, Cleveland 1978 is mysteriously righteous in ways unlike any show of its time, or any other since.
