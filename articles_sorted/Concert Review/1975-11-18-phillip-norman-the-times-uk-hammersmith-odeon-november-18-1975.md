BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN AND THE E STREET BAND HAMMERSMITH ODEON NOVEMBER 18, 1975

Even the music industry is astonished by Bruce Springsteen. An industry, peerless in the generation of legend around nonentities, of vast conceit around minimum competence, has seen its most carefully nourished protégés eclipsed at a stroke by this New Jersey loafer aged 26 who seems in every way the antithesis of star material. In America, his album, Born To Run, has earned unprecedented acclaim, while his stage performance is compared to that of Dylan, Presley and Mick Jagger. The most jaded American palates have concluded him to be the only hope for the regeneration of rock music.

Any musician who has appeared simultaneously on the covers of Time and Newsweek magazines, and whose record company is apt to purchase one fifth of a theatre's seats to encourage him, must be either wonderful or bad beyond the worst description of his species.

Having seen Springsteen at Hammersmith and being careful now in weighing my words, I can only say that he is indeed wonderful. He is as devastating a talent has pop music has ever produced, more so for having been practically produced by accident.

His records, as good as they are, leave one unprepared for the strength of his stage performance. He is discovered alone in the spotlight, a small unkempt figure in baggy trousers and a woolen hat. No studio has yet captured the resonance of his voice.

Of all analogies, the one with Dylan is the most appropriate and yet misleading. There is the same originality, uncontrollably, raging, uttered in its own unmistakable voice. But Dylan is a convert where Springsteen was born.

He is a child of rock and roll and all its clichés; the motor cycles, the funfairs the drag racers. He sees them with both illusion and disillusion with punk love and weary hindsight.

In rock's terrible conformity there is the further excitement to be felt at the birth of an entirely new character. Insubstantial, strangely innocent with his shirt hanging out, he is somehow excluded from even the smart dressed members of the E Street Band. Perhaps we see rock music's first Charlie Chaplin. Whatever we see it does represent extraordinary hope. Let us hope he remains ignorant of his power for a little while yet.

Bruce Springsteen is here at last. Not to save rock and roll or to present us with a vision of its future but to lead us to a rediscovery of all the qualities, great and small, which made it mean something in the first place; and in so doing, to entertain us like we have never been entertained before.

Wednesday night's three hour concert, the second of his long delayed British tour, ended in an explosion of fun, whose completeness was made possible only be Springsteen's ability to take us to the other extreme: we dance more euphorically to "Rosalita" and "Cadillac Ranch" because for having experienced the bitter nostalgia and rich ironies of "Racing In the Street" an the searing intensity of "Badlands".

Springsteen and his infinitely flexible, almost absurdly enthusiastic six piece band, seemed to be at the top of their form. They began with a dramatic arrangement of "Follow That Dream" , an old Presley song whose lyric served as a manifesto of the entire evening; ten minutes later the singer was already down among the audience delivering a verse of "Tenth Avenue Freezeout" while hoistered high on the shoulders of his supporters.

Other expressions of ebullience abounded, the best example coming, amazingly, from the dark side of the footlights. As Springsteen prepared himself to sing the first verse of "Hungry Heart", his most likeable song, he was beaten to it by the fans, who carried the melody lustily and with praiseworthy precision.

An awareness of his responsibilities leads Springsteen to vary the content of his concerts from night to night. Manchester's surprises included the dedication of Woody Guthries, "This Land Is Your Land" to Bob Marley and a storming folk rock treatment of John Fogerty's "Who'll Stop The Rain". There was the debut too of a song which examines someone's responses on the night that Presley died told in quick images and pop references stitched together with a kind of flash cutting technique and arranged in the spare Nashville inflected style of "Wreck On the Highway" , a mode which seems increasingly likely to provide his next major source of musical inspiration.

There were sequences which illuminatingly juxtaposed songs of similar or contrasting attitudes and there was the warming realisation that his new up tempo songs , disappointingly thin when heard on "The River", worked perfectly in the context for which they, clearly, they had been designed.

He left us with a new illusion; that after 25 years of larking about this at last was rock and roll and what everybody else does ought to go by some other name.
