That phrase, delivered as a spiritual incantation in the title track of Bruce Springsteen's latest album, is a theme that's often played out in his music.

Springsteen's songs always have been powered by a combination of hard times and joy – and the mixture was as potent as ever in a generous, age-defiant 2 hours and 50 minutes for a packed house on Friday at the Tampa Bay Times Forum.

The show was the only Florida stop by the Boss and the E Street Band on the opening leg of its Wrecking Ball tour, the first since the death of one of the group's defining members, saxophonist Clarence Clemons. Springsteen found ways to acknowledge the Big Man, his longtime on-stage foil, all night – in ways subtle and grandly symbolic.

"We're here with some old friends and some new ones", Springsteen told the crowd in the early going, "but the mission of the E Street Band remains the same: To bring the glorious power of music and shoot it straight into your heart tonight."

On Friday, the man's aim was true.

At 62, Springsteen couldn't be more skilled at his craft. Not many rock stars of his vintage could open the show with a salvo of songs from a new album that worked as powerfully as "We Take Care of Our Own" and "Wrecking Ball."

The former, bolstered by a 5-piece horn section, was an arena-ready anthem that downshifted ambitiously – and effectively – into the understated introduction of "Wrecking Ball", which hushed the crowd in the verses and encouraged fist-pumping in its exuberant chorus.

An old favorite, "Prove It All Night", turned the spotlight on one of the new friends, saxophonist Jake Clemons, the Big Man's nephew. His spot-on solo was an intense and joyous moment for fans that look at the E Street Band as extended family as much as a musical ensemble.

There were plenty of those electric moments in that one song alone, ranging from the Boss and lifelong pal Steven Van Zandt sharing the microphone in the final chorus to Springsteen pulling a broken guitar string off his instrument to hand to a fan in the front row.

Springsteen introduced the band in an R&B flavored "My City of Ruins", recognizing Van Zandt, guitarist Nils Lofgren, pianist Roy Bittan, drummer Max Weinberg, singer-guitarist Patti Scialfa, bassist Garry Tallent, violinist Soozie Tyrell and keyboardist Charlie Giordano, the latter in the slot left vacant by the death of Danny Federici in 2008.

"Are we missing anybody?" Springsteen shouted, another Clemons reference as a spotlight shone on his empty place on stage. "If you're here and we're here, they're here", he said of the missing musicians.

If all this sounds maudlin, it wasn't. The band rocked rambunctiously on "Waiting on a Sunny Day", "The Promised Land" and a doo-wop wall-of-sound version of the Temptations' "The Way You Do the Things You Do." On Wilson Pickett's "634-5789", Springsteen crowd-surfed back to the stage from a platform in the middle of the floor, obviously forgetting his age in a senior moment.

There were serious moments, most notably "American Skin (41 Shots)", Springsteen's song about the police shooting of unarmed New York resident in 1999. Springsteen delivered it without comment, but the line about getting "killed just for living in your American skin" hit hard in the wake of the killing of Sanford teen Trayvon Martin.

In the end, however, the show was about savoring happiness amid the tough times, a lesson hammered home in the glorious finale of "Born to Run", "Dancing in the Dark", "Glory Days" and "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out." The latter was halted for one last long ovation for the Big Man.

"Tonight is about hellos and goodbyes", Springsteen said, "the things that leave us and the things that remain."

Obviously, fans will mourn the losses, but what remains is worth celebrating.
