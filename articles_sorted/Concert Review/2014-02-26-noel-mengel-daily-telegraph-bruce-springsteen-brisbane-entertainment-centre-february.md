FROM the surprise opening song - a version of The Bee Gees' Stayin' Alive - to a celebratory climax with Highway to Hell, Bruce Springsteen's show at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre last night was one none of those present will ever forget.

By the time Pearl Jam's Eddie Veddie joined Springsteen and the E Street Band for the AC/DC anthem, the band had been on stage for more than three-and-a- half hours, but Springsteen wasn't done with yet.

He returned for one final song, with just his acoustic guitar and harmonica, a dramatic, intense version of Thunder Road from his classic Born To Run album.

Earlier, the show had unfolded in ways that not even the Boss or the band were expecting, delving into songs from his first album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., then playing his 1973 album, The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, start to finish.

That opening version of Stayin' Alive sounded more like Curtis Mayfield than The Bee Gees, but it certainly paid respect to the city's most famous band.

There was some more of that with a sizzling version of The Saints' Just Like Fire Would.

And respect - to his audience, to the power of his band, to the timeless power of 40 years of songs, to the revitalising power of rock'n'roll - is what a Springsteen show is all about.

At one point he gives a rap about the E Street Band, working the stage like a revivalist preacher, asking the audience: "We have come all this way to ask one question, 'Have you got the spirit?'" before launching into a roaring version of early song Spirit in the Night. The song is one of their earliest yet they attack it with relish, making it sound as exciting as something they had just written at soundcheck.

There are parts of the show which people now are coming, the young boy from the audience asked on stage to sing, inevitable highlights like Badlands, Dancing in the Dark and Tom Morello's guitar pyrotechnics on The Ghost of Tom Joad. But there are other parts of the show which are completely in the moment.

There is the joy of seeing his long-time guitar lieutenant Steve Van Zandt, who missed last year's Australian tour, return to the fray, and the way that Springsteen bounces off his energy. He goes crowd-surfing and returns to the stage with a toy kangaroo and someone's phone stuff in his pocket, at time working his way down near the back of the room to get closer to his fans, still singing.

With Van Zandt back on board the E Street Band are an 18-strong force of nature. I still have no idea how they can respond to crowd requests, held aloft on signs in the audience, with about three seconds' notice, and somehow play them as perfectly as something they have rehearsed for months.

Springsteen is delighted to go off-script, playing requests like You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) and Sherry Darling from 1980 album The River.

Playing The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle is not an obvious choice but they make that work too, concluding with the tension and release of the extraordinary Rosalita, and the song suite New York Serenade, joined by guest Brisbane string players for the occasion.

The question for the crowd at this sold-out concert was how could it match those two shows in this venue last year? But they left nothing in the tank as they delivered the kind of intensity rarely heard in stadium shows. They matched those shows all right.

On it goes: Darlington County, The Rising, Born To Run, the nightly rendition of Tenth Avenue Freeze-out, honouring the memory of the late E Streeters Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici.

Springsteen and his band have loved every minute of these two Australian tours in the past year, and Springsteen leaves the stage promising to return.

And this morning there are 12,000 people walking on air saying, I saw it and I still don't believe it. Incredible.
