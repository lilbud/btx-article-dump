One reason the right hates the left is that, like the devil, the left has the best tunes. Rock'n'roll was subversive when it was "race music" and it got rougher when white boys picked it up. Elvis Presley's first pelvic thrusts on television in 1956 provoked a critic for The New York Times to rant that the "commercialised overstimulation of youth's physical impulses is certainly a gross national disservice".

The conservatives' tragedy is that they've never had anyone to sing for them.

Bob Dylan would have disappeared without trace if he'd written "The Times They Aint A-Changin"'. Jimmy Barnes never thought of doing Middle Class Man.

The revolution lives on in Bruce Springsteen, troubadour of love and hard times, poet laureate to Barack Obama. His concert at Homebush on Wednesday was astounding, the greatest I have seen - 3½ hours of musical genius emitting enough energy to power an aluminium smelter. I was staggered when he dived into the audience and then crowd-surfed back to the stage, borne aloft by a hundred ecstatic fans.

You've still got it, Boss, still got it. No retreat, baby, no surrender.
