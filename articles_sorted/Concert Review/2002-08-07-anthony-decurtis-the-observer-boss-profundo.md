Only a stirring finale saves Bruce Springsteen's world tour opener from the ghosts of 11 September

Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Continental Airlines Arena, New Jersey Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band opening a year-long world tour in New Jersey would be a major event at any time. After all, the Boss himself once wryly likened his relationship to his home state to that of Santa Claus and the North Pole. But the release of The Rising last month raised the emotional stakes - and audience expectations - even higher. The 20,000-capacity Continental Airlines Arena sits just across the Hudson River from New York, virtually in the shadow of the skyline that was forever altered by the terrorist attacks on 11 September last year.

The aftermath of those attacks is the ambitious subject of The Rising. On the day of this show it was announced that the album had sold more than 500,000 copies in its first week in the US. This week it will enter the charts at number one, Springsteen's first album (other than a greatest hits collection) to do so in 15 years.

But if the stage was dramatically set, this show proved one of the rare moments in which Springsteen failed to rise to the occasion. From the start the singer and his band (augmented by violinist Soozie Tyrell) seemed inhibited by the painful issues their music raised. They performed five songs - 'The Rising', 'Lonesome Day', 'Prove It All Night', 'Fuse' and 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' - before the typically effusive Springsteen addressed the crowd, primarily to request silence for the spare, moving versions of 'Empty Sky' and 'You're Missing'. On his 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Street Band, Springsteen exerted a commanding presence, feverishly preaching about the transcendent power of rock'n'roll. On this night, however, he was more contained, as if concerned that such emotional displays might be inappropriate or even disrespectful. The two-and-a-half-hour, 22-song set - generous by any normal measure, but spartan by Springsteen's epic standards - was another sign of his uncharacteristic restraint.

Opening-night glitches didn't help. Half the evening's songs came from The Rising - too much new material for a show on this scale. In addition, most of those songs had never been performed live, and the 10-piece band was too preoccupied simply getting the arrangements right to play at full strength, let alone swing.

That said, the E Street Band is still one of rock's most propulsive outfits.

The classic 'Two Hearts' featured Springsteen and his trusty sidekick, guitarist Steven Van Zandt, screaming their harmonies into a single microphone, their lips inches apart. The crowd transformed 'Waitin' on a Sunny Day', a seeming throwaway on The Rising , into a lusty singalong that brought Springsteen up short. 'I'm very impressed', he said, and the grin on his face testified to his sincerity.

Springsteen also took care to ensure that his focus on 11 September did not fuel a sense of vengeance. Content to let the often ambiguous songs speak for themselves, he never mentioned or even alluded to the events of that day. In his introduction to 'My City of Ruins', one of the core tracks on The Rising, he spoke of the song's original plea for the rebuilding of Asbury Park, the Jersey Shore town that provided inspiration for many of his early songs. And he paired 'Into the Fire', a song about the heroism of police and firefighters at the World Trade Centre, with 'American Skin (41 Shots)', a brooding ballad based on the police shooting of a West African immigrant in the Bronx in 1999.

As an encore, Springsteen unleashed 'Born to Run', 'Glory Days' and 'Thunder Road', three hits that shook the hall to its rafters. He brought the night to a close with 'Born in the USA' and 'Land of Hope and Dreams'. That was Springsteen at his finest - in one song examining in brutal terms the coruscating impact of the Vietnam War on the American soul, in the other evoking spiritually charged imagery of America as a new promised land.

Over the resounding folk-rock chords of 'Land', Springsteen borrowed the stirring gospel conceit of the train to heaven, nodded to the Im pressions"

'People Get Ready' and sang: 'This train/Dreams will not be thwarted/This train/Faith will be rewarded/This train/ Hear the steel wheels sing/ This train/Bells of freedom ring."

The ending struck the note of healing Springsteen had been searching for all night. If it was a shame he failed to find that sweet spot earlier, it can't be said that redemption came too late.
