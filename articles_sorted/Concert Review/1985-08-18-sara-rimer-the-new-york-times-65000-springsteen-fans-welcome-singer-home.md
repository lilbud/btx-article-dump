EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 18— After 13 months on the road - after playing to sellout crowds in Australia, Europe, Japan and cities all across America - Bruce Springsteen came home tonight.

The New Jersey boy who grew up to be the current king of rock-and-roll was welcomed back by more than 65,000 of his fans, on their feet in Giants Stadium, fists in the air, screaming every word of his first song of the evening, "Born in the U.S.A."

"All my people out there!" he shouted before one number. "How have things been here in New Jersey?"

Judging from the crowd's response, things couldn't have been better. They belonged to him from the moment he and his E Street band took the stage, shortly after 8 P.M., for the first of six concerts here. Until about midnight, Giants Stadium was transformed into an enormous outdoor dancehall as his fans danced in the aisles, embracing one another every time Mr.

Springsteen went into an old favorite.

"Brrruuucccce! Brrruuucccce! Brrrruuucccce!" they kept screaming. Their enthusiasm was shared by the performer. the Garden of Eden, he said, had been moved, and now was in New Jersey.

During the raucous "Thunder Road", Neil Jiorle, 29, of Long Branch, N.J, grabbed his wife, Lisa, 25, and spun her up and down the aisle. They had gone to hear Bruce Springsteen at honky-tonk bars more than 10 years ago, long before anyone dreamed he would play Giants Stadium.

Mr. Springsteen returned to New Jersey an international rock star, an American symbol, a favorite of politicians (Governor Kean and Mayor Koch both attended tonight's concert) and a married man.

"But he's still the same old Bruce", said 26-year-old Beverly Snow.

And he still wore the same old bandana headband, blue jeans and T-shirt - a uniform repeated on thousands of young men in the crowd - as he filled the stadium with his tales of disillusioned factory workers, out-of-work Vietnam veterans and madly-in-love young men and women driving Jersey roads on hot summer nights.

Glory Days Were There

"This is a song about getting old", Mr. Springsteen said before singing "Glory Days." "And I'm old. I'm 35. Yeah." He was all over the stage tonight, dancing up and down the steps, mugging with the saxophonist Clarence Clemons and, at one point, falling on his back in mock exhaustion. Mr.

Springsteen was not old tonight.

"Glory Days" is a tale of good times long gone for a former high school baseball star. Tonight the glory days were in Giants Stadium.

At the end of the first set, Mr. Springsteen gave a brief sermon on caring for the less fortunate. "If you say you're from New Jersey", he said, "you have a responsibility to your state."

He went on to say that the Community Food Bank of New Jersey and the Food and Hunger hot line of New York both had representatives in the audience and needed support. "In every state people are going to be hungry", he said. "A lot of people are falling though the bottom. They ain't getting caught in no safety net. They're hurting and they need some help.

"Remember New York and New Jersey", he continued, "this is your hometown."

The crowd cheered.

While there was a smattering of celebrities in the audience - Raquel Welch could be seen furiously eating an apple during the first set - this was a kind of "just folks" crowd, caught up in a spirit that was more like a rock-and- roll revival than a 1980's rock concert. Limousines and fancy cars were far outnumbered by Chevrolets, vans and pickup trucks.

No Punk or Glitter

This was blue jeans and cowboy boots, not glitter and punk haircuts. And while no one could doubt their enthusiasm, officials praised the fans as particularly well behaved.

Tommy Bartley, a 24-year-old ironworker from Nutley, N.J., was here. So was his friend Jimmy Frotton, a 23-year-old bartender from the same town. So was John O'Neill, a 21-year-old heating and air-conditioner installer from Kearny, N.J. So was his friend, 22-year-old Jim Keim, an electrician from Kearny. So was Paul Cardenas, a 21-year-old handyman from Queens. And so was Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam War veteran who wrote about his war experiences in the book "Born on the Fourth of July."

"I've been sitting in this wheelchair for the past 18 years", said Mr.

Kovic, a friend of the singer. "And I can only thank Bruce Springsteen for all he's done for Vietnam veterans. 'Born in the U.S.A.' is a beautiful song that has helped me personally to heal."

Among those paying homage to the singer was Jeff McCutchen, 20, who drove from Albany with three friends, 15 Springsteen tapes and a map of New Jersey.

Before the concert they made a pilgrimage through their idol's working-class hometown of Freehold, his new town of Rumson as well as Asbury Park that Mr.

Springsteen immortalized in his first album.
