There are two types of Bruce Springsteen shows: The ones that offer a bounty of the blue collar anthems that will never, ever rust despite their age (the "Jungleland"s and "Thunder Road"s). And the ones that detour into the creases of his remarkable catalog, happily surprising the legions of die-hards but sending casual fans home with a disappointed shrug because he didn't play "Jungleland" or "Thunder Road."

Saturday night's two hour and 45-minute romp at Aaron's Amphitheatre at Lakewood should have appeased both camps. The first 90 minutes zig-zagged from the punky burst of The Clash's "Clampdown" – with the E Street Band brass section ingeniously recast as a drumline – to a trio of memories from "The River", including Springsteen's solo spin behind Roy Bittan's white baby grand for the pensive "Independence Day."

Springsteen, a black-clad musical Jedi sporting flexible wrist braces and a rocker scruff (has he been hanging around fill-in guitarist Tom Morello too much?), didn't travel from behind his mic stand much at first. But he did stroll in tandem with the top-hatted Nils Lofgren for "The Ties That Bind" and stepped aside to allow Jake Clemons some space as he blasted his first solo of the night, much to the approval of the whooping crowd.

Those E Streeters – and newly minted Rock and Roll Hall of Famers – are a small convention of musicians and, as always, they balanced Springsteen's emotion and passion with a steady snap (drummer Max Weinberg) and melodies that veered from pretty shuffles ("She's the One") to sticky stomps ("Adam Raised a Cain").

The addition of Morello, the Rage Against the Machine guitarist (and Springsteen pal) replacing Steven Van Zandt while he fulfills his acting duties, is an interesting one. Morello's spiky guitar adds a metal-edged, squawky dimension to songs that doesn't always sound natural in E Street land and his showboating on "High Hopes" (playing with his teeth) and "The Ghost of Tom Joad" (scratching at his guitar like it was a turntable), while exciting in a live setting, seemed misplaced against the band's cool charisma.

That isn't to say that Morello isn't a guitar wizard. He's a tremendous player, but Van Zandt was missed.

Springsteen didn't neglect his tradition of scouring the audience – primarily the general admission pit in his sightline – for sign requests and scored a beauty with one that read, "Help! A NY-er Trapped in GA." With a nod and a grin, Springsteen obliged with a cover of Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped", and led the nearly sold-out crowd in the song's air-punching chorus.

An early sing-along accompanied the easy-swinging "Cadillac Ranch", but it wasn't until the band kicked into "Badlands" – with the umpteenth, yet always welcome, Springsteen count in of "ah-one, two, three, fah" – that a subtle shift occurred and those casual fans suddenly put down their beers and popped out of their seats again.

Even those who didn't know "Drive All Night" (back to "The River" we go!) had to feel their insides tighten a little as Springsteen clenched his eyes and ripped the heart out of the tortured love song.

But seconds later, the houselights flipped up and the "whoa-oh-oh-oh"s of "Born to Run" filled the venue, again marking itself as a pinnacle of any live concert experience.

The crew hustled through "Dancing in the Dark", that anthem of middle-aged discontentment wrapped in a jaunty melody, but not before Springsteen scooped up a young girl from the crowd and hoisted her on his shoulders, the two of them sharing rhythm and song as he crouched down to allow her to sing.

While this wasn't Springsteen's most physical show – his shirt didn't even appear sweat-soaked until halfway through the set, which is beyond an anomaly – he is still the hardest-working cat out there (and at 64, no less).

But it was a blissful sight when he stripped down to a bicep-baring T-shirt, climbed atop the piano, then hopped down and glided into some boxing jabs as the smooth intro to "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" unfurled.

This was Springsteen's chance to mingle in the crowd – and he did – and also the time to memorialize Clarence Clemons ("and the Big Man joined the band") and keyboardist Danny Federici on video during the song. The heart-wrenching musical time out that Springsteen employed during the 2012 tour following Clemons' death has been eliminated, but the tribute is no less significant.

Wrapping the night with "Shout" and a suitably crunchy cover of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell", Springsteen might have disappointed a few fans hoping to hear a greater number of familiar songs.

But with an inventory as vast as his – and at this point in a career that might not always include two-year tours – it's advised to appreciate every moment.
