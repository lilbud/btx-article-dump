TO ANYONE who wasn't Born in the USA, America is still defined by the clutter of images it sends us: television, cinema, music, cars, fast food, anything.

Some of those images play back on themselves, like some endlessly recurring echo; so we see moves that are filled with 'America', music that is built on refractions of its place of birth.

Go see Paris, Texas, or hear Guy Clark's 'Old No.1'.

To somebody born and raised in Britain, without family or material ties to the American continent, the land is sometimes hard to conceive of as a real place.

We insist on reducing it to something our tiny island can measure up to. The USA is compressed into a booming steel city, or a cold western plain, or a backlot of tenements – whatever image was last pressed on our retina.

Actually going there and finding these places real and breathing and just part of some far wider, deeper place can be a slow shock to the system. Each time I've visited I've felt vaguely out of sorts, felt something akin to Woody Allen's 'West Coast' sickness in Annie Hall.

Our understanding of American music is mostly shored up by the same spindly worldview. If the American music business has stuck Billboard tags onto a spread that's almost too multifarious to grasp, British ears are even more Philistine than that.

Even now 'American rock' is meant to encompass everything, in sweeping and derogatory tones.

But it's this huge, drifting idea of 'America' that casts rock's strange and long-standing spell on an English boy's mind. The American tradition of rock'n'roll – of Berry, Presley, Richard, Bonds, Ryder, Shannon – never had real links to a country without Chevys and drive-in movies: these were and maybe still are alien, dangerous things to speak of to people brought up in Home Counties or Northern smoke.

For us, the tradition is one of words and sounds that smell of foreign pleasures – even as the explicitness of pop music has grown tediously clear in its dealings with sex and spectacle.

It's a tradition of romance, one that persists into the cycle of the digital era. Even The Clash, once the nub of a new wave against that tradition, made their best record with an old song called 'Brand New Cadillac'.

IN BRUCE Springsteen, a man who is apparently bearing the heroic standard of rock for all America, our second-hand relationship with rock'n'roll reaches its own apotheosis.

In 1984, Springsteen chose to release a record that sets out to fulfill and transcend all the promises and invitations extended in his earlier music. Born In The USA is a masterpiece that practically chokes with emotion, an amazing rock counterpart to Womack's soul bible of The Poet II.

American critics, floored by its perspicacious insight into the state of their own country, are barely able to believe that the man they put so much trust in has managed to deliver on that faith so completely. It has stormed British doors less effectively; America is still far away, and Springsteen hasn't been seen here for a long time. Yet a single listen rekindles and finally defines for keeps what it is about him that can still be valuable to us.

A British music audience is supposed to be somehow more astute, more healthily sceptical than its transatlantic cousin, though considering our current pacemakers one suspects that gullibility is a keener touchstone.

When Springsteen first approached us with Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ and The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle, scepticism came in spades.

Blatherings about a new Dylan would mean nothing today, but then (1973) they taunted our allegiance to a master we once claimed as practically our own.

Singer-songwriters were entering their last boom period – it was the time of Joni Mitchell's For The Roses and Paul Simon's There Goes Rhymin' Simon – and it seemed natural enough to plant this verbose, crow-voiced man from New York State in the same patch.

Asbury Park jostled with half-glimpsed city dwellers, like the bus which may or may not have stopped at 82nd Street, and the lines in the songs stretched way past the succinct metre of pop. If the record was meant to be a city street carnival, the sound of it failed hopelessly in trying to convey the right air, everything ploughed cloudily together.

Yet these were seeds of memorable pop material. Greg Kihn purloined 'For You' for his 1977 Again LP, threw out half the lyric and made it an exuberant, tense message of fidelity; Manfred Mann made a baroque and irritatingly memorable thing out of Blinded By The Light.

The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle – it sounded like a marriage between Eugene O'Neill and Wilson Pickett – took the feeling of ponderous, writerly art even further. A pretty, closely-watched love song like 'Sandy' was still weighted with superfluous detail; the half-intended suite on the second side had some of the rambling mystique of early Van Morrison mixed with anthemic bursts of bar-band rock. Strings and odd instruments like recorders clotted in the corners of the sound.

The photograph of Springsteen's band on the cover's backside made them look uncannily like The Doobie Brothers, while the artist himself resembled the Pacino of Panic In Needle Park and Serpico, a wiry, pointed little man with a Jesus beard.

In fact, those records scarcely broke the surface over here. Their moments of tenderness were too brusque and fleeting, We expected songwriters to pour themselves out through voluminous love letters. 'Wild Billy's Circus Story', a big top vignette from E Street Shuffle, displayed a writer with a soft heart for little folks, not the allusive, Blakean juggler we expected a 'new Dylan' to be.

This America was one we hardly recognised.

AT ANY event, when Springsteen was finally shoved into Britain by an over- zealous record company, it was the year Dylan himself chose to release his last great record, Blood On The Tracks. Against such a reflective opus, Born To Run sounded wildly bombastic, an opera set against a sonata. We were surprised to find that there was no basis to compare them.

The collectors record of 1975 was probably Little Feat's The Last Record Album. In Lowell George's pilled-up vistas of Southern women, whisky breath and dusty railroad territories we were sold a vagrant's America that seemed irresistible at the time.

But Springsteen's America was about to come much closer.

Posters showing a guy with a biker jacket and a puckish grin, leaning up against a big black sax player, began sprouting over London. I remember the endless graffiti variations scrawled under the tube posters' legend: "FINALLY The World Is Ready For..." Then this crashing record Born To Run came gunning out through radios late that summer.

If it was a cool record to own, it wasn't as cool as Feat's or Dylan's; and we stopped short at calling him messiah. Reviewers clubbed down his Hammersmith shows, fuelled on animosity towards Jon Landau's notorious "future of rock'n'roll" declamation. Springsteen came and went, like any other visitor.

TODAY, BORN To Run – in terms of spiritual release and hotwire intensity – stands as the blood brother of Born In The USA. Springsteen's songs still sprawled with words, but they were at the service of a vision that was truly born of running – of sprinting to the sound of classic, American rock'n'roll.

There were comparisons with Phil Spector because of the ringing crescendoes the sound dealt out: and the candour with his characters' secrets in this urban 'Jungleland' might have suggested a link with old Lou Reed. Except Reed never went for broke as Springsteen did.

As the noise settled down a little, we realised that this really was a giant at work. The mumble of his first records suddenly focused into a voice as tearing and impassioned as anything since the Sun Presley; and the words were those of a humanitarian outlaw, a man who could walk alive from a Tenth Avenue freeze-out (to the accompaniment of horns that blared like heavy traffic) and still treat his girl with bluff, burning affection – even if she turned out to be "just another tramp of hearts". His band swaggered and roared around him.

It was the most romantic, inflamed, proud, jewelled, ecstatic rock music an English teenager could have heard in 1975.

'Night' was a song that buzzed through your head as you combed your hair and prepared to bust the city in half – "every muscle in your body sings as the highway ignites" – and 'She's The One' cut a boy to his heart as he gazed on some unmissable, untouchable girl. It was a grey time, and Springsteen's America spoke in a way that we too could put trust in – for this man was embattled and frustrated, not some late hangdog hippie. He sounded like he worked and sweated and cried.

It kept him afloat after we ritually torpedoed America with 'our' new wave.

The ruinous legal dispute that kept him away for three years ended with Darkness On The Edge Of Town, a slow and pensive record. The time away had hardened the brimming, explosive youth of Born To Run into this frowning and determined music.

The refugees of the "last chance power drive" end up burned and blind in 'Something In The Night'; 'Factory' is an even darker 'Night'. In the studio, Springsteen and Landau dispensed with the echo and effect of BTR and huddled the players close.

There was rage here – 'Adam Raised A Cain' – and a pride in love ('Candy's Room') which intensified anything in Springsteen's past. The centrepiece is 'Racing In The Streets'. It again celebrates something which English experience didn't contain – strip racing with cars built from scratch – with a core of uncomprehending despair that the track finally leads nowhere. In a final ambiguity, the song ends on an instrumental code that seems to imply the sun rising again to dispel the darkness.

As time went on, Springsteen passed into the currency of the stadium visitor.

His shows took away our breath, because he played longer and longer than anybody could stand – and it still held defiantly together, rock'n'roll medleys, Mitch Ryder and Searchers tunes, everything.

BY 1980 and The River, Springsteen's status in his native land bordered on the holy; here, with Costello and Weller in full flight, he'd begun to seem old.

The River flowed over four long sides, and it offered easy meat to those who scented a situation coming full circle. Cars and girls, girls and cars, and all running through the same streets which had been banging us between the eyes as well as the ears: since Born To Run we'd seen Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Blue Collar, and the mythology that once seemed a Springsteen patent had been declared open season.

Where there'd once been 'new Dylans' there were now 'new Springsteens'.

There are a lot of plain boisterous tunes on The River, like 'I'm A Rocker', 'Out In The Street', 'Jackson Cage'. Some asked how old this guy thought he was – 18, 19? (Springsteen was 31). Wasn't he a little mature to be singing "ooh, ooh, I gotta crush on you"?

The River was concentrated passion of rock'n'roll playing: superbly recorded and organised, it unfolds like one of Springsteen's live shows. Each of the four sides ends with a soliloquy – 'Independence Day', 'The River', 'Stolen Car', 'Wreck On The Highway' – that shows someone looking as close as he might for solace or a word of hope from a companion.

In six years we had all grown older, and in 'Stolen Car' (perhaps the saddest of all his songs) the point hurts like a heart broken beyond repair: "She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote/When our love was young and bold/She said last night she read those letters/And they made her feel one hundred years old."

WITH NEBRASKA it seemed we had lost sight of Springsteen's America for good.

Now that we have Born In The USA it feels like an interlude, a basement tape.

Springsteen sings these shockingly desolate songs alone with his guitar, eerily distant, as if he really were playing on the other side of some great gulf. It almost suggests the atmosphere of ancient country blues. In 'My Father's House' a man goes home to find home gone; in 'Atlantic City' is the desperate hope of the damned. The two brothers of 'Highway Patrolman' reflect the deepest of all American divisions, between the city and the country, and in 'Nebraska' itself Springsteen translates Terence Mallick's Badlands to an unrepentant confession.

Nebraska – the title itself holds up an unknown America. We have any number of mirrors on New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco...but like the bleak cover shot looking across a car hood out to nothingness, this place has no face, no name in our store of the American image.

Nebraska is a gloomy, fractured record that displays Springsteen's particular allegiance to a working people, as faceless as the title he chose. It roots him in ground much older than his other music might at first have reflected.

His declared liking for the work of John Ford makes sense of the way this writing runs: a grand, bracingly wide genre that is taking years to track through the details.

IT IS 1984, ten years after he wrote Born To Run. The time seems littered with bases of optimism and dashed hope, most of them inscribed with a Springsteen line: "Well Sir, I guess there's just a meanness in this world". Born In The USA is his anniversary record, the second breath taken in the spirit of Born To Run – this time bolstered by experience and a reluctance to invest blind faith.

The life and vigour of of this music, selected from more than 50 songs cut at these sessions, is itself a testament to old-fashioned virtues – most of it played live in the studio, delivered with a catapulting relish. The songs leap, shake, race from the grooves. Springsteen's voice pounds like a fist on this muscular, perfectly honed American rock.

Yet the words are creased with a suspicion that there are many, perhaps too many things to be put right in this USA. 'Cover Me' asks for love to put out the eyes; 'Downbound Train' smashes a man's heart on the ground; the title song threads together Vietnam and an empty future in a way that belies its thunderous music. If it's preaching, it's the sort that everybody does in bars, on trains, in front of their TVs.

The driving, impassioned certainty of this doubt about our progress is, I think, the most a rock performer will ever give us. In the magnificent 'Dancing In The Dark', Springsteen practically explodes with his right to take the next step, and it's this brinkmanship which charges his whole music.

Instead of wasting his strength on rhetoric of the everybody's-got-to-live- together ilk, the singer simply holds out his hand.

In the example he sets – of exhausting and ridiculously generous tours, disarming frankness in public statement and a general distance from the excesses which make the rock star such a dislikable creature – Springsteen puts himself closer to his art than any other major rock performer.

That music in turn feels closer to me, to the country I live in, than the maundering efforts our own troupers have lately thrown up. This America, of working people confused about their present and worried about their future, has turned out to be nearer home than its faraway demeanour first suggested.

The miracle of Springsteen's Born In The USA is this very universality. It's almost like a paean to anybody's home country, to the people who make up it's largest number. That half of Springsteen's sight bonds me closer to this American rock than to any Spandau Ballet drivel about "pride".

The other half consists of his instinct for the deepest pulse of rock, a tradition almost devoured by misuse. Springsteen's unshaken belief in the mystery of rock, the seizure of the heart that can't be written down, staggers scepticism. Since Born To Run, Springsteen's rock'n'roll – which has intermittently followed me in growing up over ten years – sought to grasp the spark more honestly than any other.

It almost breaks me open, because in the throes of his best music Springsteen unstoppers my reserve. His sound can remind me of every girl kissed, every closeness, every passion to achieve. It's easy to imagine how Landau felt when he wrote those words a little over ten years ago.

The spark abides, in two particular moments from Born In The USA. As the band romp to the close of 'Dancing In The Dark', Springsteen spontaneously yells "Hee-eey Baby!", as if he's suddenly recalled Bruce Channel's old song, a hit when he was 13. And in 'I'm On Fire' he refurbishes the locomotive rhythm that runs through most American music. When the music begins to fade, he slips into a falsetto that sounds like the long, lonely whistle of Elvis' 'Mystery Train'. Slowly, it winds out of earshot.

"IN THE end, it's all part of the same thing. Which is why Elvis' message was so profound. It reaches everybody, everywhere. Doesn't matter where or what the problems are or what the government is like. It's a heart. It's a human thing." Bruce Springsteen, 1984.
