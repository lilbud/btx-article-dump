Bruce Springsteen, Rock Orator, on Life, Love, Art and everything

The world of rock is not blessed with fine public speakers. It's not the pop star's game. Naturally, they don't want to address you, they want to sing to you. For most, on stage, the occasional hiatus while roadies scuttle to fix a miscreant monitor or wonky widget is a source of stomach-knotting embarrassment. Their heads drop. Eye contact is avoided. After a bit, they really think they should say something. And they do. They say, "Uhhhh... well, it's, you know like...", and turn away again. It's the same at awards ceremonies. Even though, in this instance, the call to say a few words means good news, the oratorical peaks which tower above the clouded foothills of "Uhhhh... thanks" are rarely ascended.

But Bruce Springsteen is different. He is the great rhetorician of rock'n'roll, the sole superstar who can be as well understood and even enjoyed through what he's said to multitudinous audiences the world over as through what he's sung. His heart, soul and intellect are in regular communication and after the striking set-piece tributes he's paid to Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and John Fogerty at the Hall Of Fame inductions, he's the man every other rock legend would like to be praised by when it's their turn to pick up a lifetime achievement award – or even, in the fullness, to be buried with full rock'n'roll honours.

Driven by some unanalysed instinct to explain, engage, plain hunker down and talk it over, Springsteen has been "rapping" on stage for as long as any Bossly historian can remember. Certain songs, at various points in his career have evidently carried the necessity of public confession, yarn spinning or a mixture of both. It used to be 'Growin' Up' and 'Born To Run'. From the mid-'80s on, 'My Hometown' held the key to his compulsion.

Nearly always, he begin "When I was young..." or "When I was a kid..." There was the boy Springsteen, his guitar, his parents. But with his large-spirited sense of common-man universality, perhaps mingled with a more egocentric will to wrap a fondly controlling embrace round as much of humanity as, with all mod cons, he could possibly reach, after a few years the downhome stories were obviously bumping up against wider issues and demanding that bigger ideas be expressed, conclusions essayed that could only be described as political.

His first acknowledgment that this was happening was his appearance at the MUSE No Nukes concerts in 1979. However, that night he conspicuously just sang and said nothing at all. He took one of his first critical drubbings for his reticence. But this was just a staging post, it turned out, part of a struggle for confidence.

He was blue-collar through and through. He's loathed school and learnt nothing. But he was very wary of writing or talking in ignorance. He hated the thought of making a fool of himself and debasing the currency of the home truths he did know and portray with such conviction. So, advised by his Ivy League graduate manager and mentor Jon Landau, he had set about acquiring knowledge. Films, novels, histories. He studied and started telling stadiums full of people how this new information fitted with his own experience.

Across America, he spoke up for local food banks and industrial strikers, against the maltreatment of Vietnam veterans and migrant workers. His attitude was seemingly either inspired by or just instinctively in line with Roosevelt's New Deal, and his easy way of talking to gatherings of up to 100,000 fans at a time hinted at the homespun mastery of FDR's radio "fireside chats". In interviews at the time he often used the possibly Landau-crafted phrase "the need for connection". He fulfilled it with what he called "the Loud Noise" – and the quiet word.

And because what Springsteen was about was so verbal itself, the Brucewatching critical analyses became very rich indeed. Robert Hilburn, of the LA Times, saw him defining "the struggle in life between disillusionment and dreams". Dave Marsh, of Rolling Stone, suggested that Springsteen's unprecedented approach was "a refutation of the idea that rock was anarchic rebellion. If anything his shows were a masterwork of crowd control, an adventure in pure co-operation, a challenge to chaos."

Well, Dylan made it okay to think about rock – as Springsteen said in his Hall Of Fame tribute – and these comments are not daft just because they're high- flown. Springsteen was up for it. He took it all on with a big, American emotionality. For most of the '80s, at least, his style had few detractors even in Britain, where the alleged natural reserve might have deemed him more than a tad OTT (but then the impassioned humanism of Hill Street Blues found a fervent UK response during the same period).

But, of late, Springsteen's standing and stature has been questioned more than ever before. Unloved albums, marriage ructions, even the obscure uproar of "the roadies case" encouraged the erstwhile faithful to minute examination of the great man, great spirit. Even an arch-supporter like Charles Cross of Backstreets fanzine has wondered how far Springsteen's public story has been revised and rephrased by Landau. The lines between reality, realism and myth- making, previously straddled with ease through sheer force of the artist's personality and imagination, could now be seen by the committed as intellectually crotch-threatening razor-wire fences.

And the matter of belief is very important to all but the most casual Springsteen followers. As Hilburn put it, "The important thing about Bruce isn't that he makes you believe in rock and roll or himself. He makes you believe in yourself." Then, if you stop believing...

Still, probably, this is just another phase his reputation's going through. The humanist humanised to human size. The kind of believability that has not very much to do with factual accuracy does run straight through Springsteen's music, performance, lyrics and spoken words.

As he said in his thank you speech when last year's Oscar committee declared 'Streets Of Philadelphia' the Best Original Song In A Movie: "You do your best work and you hope that it pulls out the best in your audience and some piece of it spills over into the real world and into people's everyday lives. And it takes the edge off fear and allows us to recognise each other through our veil of differences. I always thought that was one of the things popular art was supposed to be about, along with the merchandising and all the other stuff."

ROCK N ROLL From the speech inducting Bob Dylan into the Rock'N'Roll Hall Of Fame, Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, January 20, 1988:

"The first time I heard Bob Dylan, I was in the car with my mother and we were listening to, I think, WMCA, and on came that snare shot that sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind – 'Like A Rolling Stone'. And my mother, she was no stiff with rock'n'roll, she used to like the music, she listened, she sat there for a minute and she looked at me and said, That guy can't sing. But I knew she was wrong, you know. I sat there and I didn't say nothin', but I knew that I was listening to the toughest voice that I had ever heard. It was lean and it sounded somehow simultaneously young and adult.

"And I ran out and I bought the single. Then I went out and I got Highway 61 and that was all I played for weeks; looked at the cover with Bob in that satin blue jacket and the Triumph motorcycle shirt.

"And when I was a kid, Bob's voice somehow thrilled and scared me; it made me feel kind of irresponsibly innocent – and it still does – when it reached down and touched what little worldliness a 15-year-old kid in high school in New Jersey had in him at the time. Dylan – he was a revolutionary. The way that Elvis freed your body, Bob freed your mind and showed us that just because the music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellect. And he changed the face of rock'n'roll for ever and ever.

"That's all the nice things I have to say tonight. Now, about three months ago, I was watching TV and the Rolling Stone Special came on and Bob came on and he was in a real cranky mood. He was kind of bitchin' and moanin' about how his fans don't know him and nobody knows him, that they come up to him on the street and treat him like a long lost brother or something. And speaking as a fan, when I was 15 and I heard 'Like A Rolling Stone', I heard a guy like I'd never heard before, a guy that had the guts to take on the whole world and make me feel like I had to too."

From the speech inducting Creedence Clearwater Revival into The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame, Century Plaza Hotel, Los Angeles, January 12, 1993. "In 1970 suburban New Jersey was still filled with the kind of '60s spirit Easy Rider made us all so fond of. I'm referring to the scene where Dennis Hopper gets blown off his motorcycle by some redneck with a shotgun! A weekend outing at the time was still filled with the drama of possibly getting your ass kicked by a total stranger who disagreed with your fashion sense.

"Me and my band worked on Route 35 outside of Asbury Park, at a club called the Pandemonium. And so it was five 50-minute sets a night and rarely a night without a fight. We played behind a U-shaped bar that was just three feet and spitting distance from many of the patrons who came to just drink and stare and hassle the band.

"Into New Jersey came the music of John and Tom Fogerty, Doug Clifford and Stu Cook – Creedence Clearwater Revival – and for three minutes and seven seconds of 'Proud Mary' a very strained brotherhood would actually fill the room. It was simply a great song that everybody liked and it literally saved our asses on many occasions.

"Anyway I stand here tonight still envious of that music's power and simplicity. And they were hits, and hitsville was reality and poetry and a sense of the darkness of events and history, of an American tradition shot through with pride, fear, paranoia – and they rocked hard.

"Now you can't talk about Creedence without talking about John Fogerty. On the fashion front, all of Seattle should bow. John was the father of the flannel shirt. And as a songwriter only few did as much in three minutes. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist – funny too. He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out of there. He was lyrically spare and beautiful. He created a world of childhood memory and of men and women with their backs to the wall. A landscape of swamps, bayous, endless rivers, gypsy women, back porches, hang-dogs chasing ghosts, devils, bad moons rising, straight out of the blues tradition.

"So let me end by saying that in their day Creedence never got the respect they deserved. They played no-frills American music for the people."

On the 1978 tour, Springsteen would break off in the middle of 'Growin" Up to deliver variants on the following rock'n'roll fable: "When I was growing up there were two things that were unpopular in my house. One was me and the other was my guitar. Anyway, one day my mom and pop, they come to me and say, 'Bruce, it's time to get serious with your life. This guitar thing, it's okay as a hobby but you need something to fall back on.' My father, he said, 'You should be a lawyer' – which I coulda used later on in my career. He says, 'Lawyers, they run the world'.

"But my mother said, 'No, no, he should be an author, he should write books; that's a good life. You can get a little something for yourself.' But me, I wanted to play the guitar.

"Now my mother, she's real Italian, and my father, he's Irish. So they say, 'This is a big thing. You should go see the priest. Tell him we want you to be a lawyer or an author. But don't say nothin' about that goddamn guitar."

"So I went to the rectory and knocked on the door. 'Hi, Father Ray, I'm Mr. Springsteen's son.' I tell him, 'I got this problem. My father, he thinks I should be a lawyer, and my mother wants me to be an author. But me, I got this guitar."

"Father Ray says, 'This is too big a deal for me. You got to talk to God' – who I didn't know too well at the time. 'Tell Him about the lawyer and the author', Father Ray says, 'but don't say nothin' about that guitar'. Now I was worried. Where was I gonna find God, right? So I go find Clarence – he knows everybody. Clarence says, 'No sweat. I know right where He is"

"So I show up at Clarence's house in my mother's car – an old Nash Rambler. Clarence looks at me. He says, 'You gonna go vist God in that? Man, He's got like, people in Cadillacs, you know. He ain't gonna pay attention to anyone who shows up in a Nash Rambler.' But it's all I got.

"So we drive way out of town, along this old dark road. We finally came to this little house, way out in the woods, nothing around, but all the lights are on inside. There's music blasting out and a little hole in the door.

'I knock and this eye peeps out. I say, 'Uh, Clarence sent me.' So they let me in. And there's God behind the drums. On the bass drum it says G-O-D. So I said, 'God, I got this problem. My father, he wants me to be a lawyer, cause he says lawyers rule the world. And my mother, she wants me to be an author, get a little something for myself. But they just don't understand – I got this guitar."

"God looks at me. He says, 'I know, I know. See, what they don't understand is, Moses screwed up. There was supposed to be an Eleventh Commandment. Actually, Moses was so scared after ten – it was a great show, the burning bush, the thunder, lightning, you shoulda seen it – he went back down the mountain. You see, what those guys don't understand is that there was supposed to be an Eleventh Commandment. And all it said was: LET IT ROCK!'"

Regular rap on 1980 world tour: "I remember when I was nine years old and I was sittin' in front of the TV set and my mother had Ed Sullivan on and on came Elvis. I remember right from that time, I looked at her and I said, 'I wanna be just... like... that'. But I grew up and I didn't want to be just like that no more. Because he was like the biggest dreamer. He was like a big liberator. I remember I was sittin' at home when a friend of mine called and told me that he died, which wasn't that big a surprise at the time because I'd seen him a few months earlier in Philadelphia. I thought a lot about it – how somebody could've had so much could in the end lose so bad and how dreams don't mean nothin' unless you're strong enough to fight for 'em and make 'em come true. You gotta hold on to yourself."

Regular introduction to 'Born To Run',1988 Tunnel Of Love Express world tour: "This is an old song which I wrote when I was 24 years old, sitting on the edge of my bed in Long Beach, New Jersey, and thinking, Here I come, world! When I wrote it, I guess I figured it was a song about a guy and a girl who wanted to run and keep on running. But as I got older and as I sang it over the years, it sort of opened up, and I guess I realised that it was about two people searching for something better. Anyway, this song has kept me good company on my search. I hope it's kept you good company on your search."

LIFE Regular introduction to The Animals' 'It's My Life', mid-'70s:

"I grew up in this small town about 20 miles inland. I remember it was in this dumpy, two-storey, two-family house, next door to this gas station. And my mom, she was a secretary and she worked downtown. And my father, he worked a lotta different places, worked in a rug mill for a while, and he was a guard down at the jail for a while. I can remember when he worked down there, he used to come back real pissed off, drunk, sit in the kitchen.

"At night, about nine o'clock, he used to shut off all the lights, every light in the house. And he'd sit in the kitchen with a six-pack and a cigarette. [When I got home] I'd stand there in that driveway, afraid to go in the house, and I could see the screen door, I could see the light of my pop's cigarette.

"I used to slick my hair back real tight so he couldn't tell how long it was gettin' and try to sneak through the kitchen. But the old man, he'd catch me every night and he'd drag me back into that kitchen. He'd make me sit down at that table in the dark, and he would sit there tellin' me. And I can remember just sittin' there in the dark, him tellin' me... tellin' me, tellin' me, tellin' me.

"Pretty soon he'd ask me what I thought I was doin' with myself, and we'd always end up screamin' at each other. My mother she'd always end up runnin' in from the front room, cryin' and tryin' to pull him off me, try to keep us from fightin' with each other. And I'd always, I'd always end up runnin' out the back door, pullin' away from him, runnin' down the driveway, screamin' at him, tellin' him, tellin' him, tellin' him how it was my life and I was gonna do what I wanted to do."

From an introduction to 'The River', Born In The USA tour, Coliseum, Los Angeles, September, 1985: "When I was growin' up, me and my dad we used to go at it all the time. It got to where we were fightin' so much that I'd stay outta the house a lot. In the summertime it wasn't so bad, but when the winter came... I remember bein' downtown and it would get so cold. And when the wind would blow I used to have this phone booth that I used to stand in. I used to stand there and call my girl and get her to call me back and then talk to her for hours at a time, all night.

"I can remember one time I had a motorcycle accident. I was laid up in bed and he had a barber come in and cut my hair. I can remember tellin' him that I hated him. I told him that I hated him and I would never, ever, forget. He used to tell me, 'Man, I can't wait till the army gets you. Man when the army gets you, they're gonna make a man outta ya. They're gonna cut all that hair off, and they'll finally make a man outta ya.' I remember the day I got my draft notice in the mail, I hid it from my folks. Then, three days before I was supposed to go up for my physical, me and my buddies went out and stayed up all night. I remember when we got in the bus that mornin', we were so scared. 'Cause it was in '68, and the Vietnam War was goin' on. And we went up and we took the physical and I failed. But I can remember comin' home, walkin' in the kitchen, and my mom and pop sittin' there. And they asked me, 'Where you been for three days?' And I said, 'I had to take my physical'. And my dad said, 'What happened?' And I said, 'I failed'. And he said, 'That's good'."

Introduction to 'Mansion On The Hill', Born in The USA tour, Civic Centre, St Paul, Minnesota, June 29, 1984 l: "My father was always transfixed by money. He used to drive out of town and look at this big white house. It became a kinda touchstone for me. Now, when I dream, sometimes I'm on the outside looking in – and sometimes I'm the man on the inside."

From the introduction to 'My Father's House' at the benefit for the Christic Institute (independent watchdog on American government), Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, November 17, 1990: "I had this habit for a long time. I used to get in my car and I would drive back through my old neighbourhood in the town I grew up in. I'd always drive past the old houses I used to live in. I'd do it, sometimes late at night. I got so I would do it really regularly, two or three, four times a week, for years, and I eventually got to wondering, what the hell am I doing? So I went to see a psychiatrist, this is true, and I said, 'Doc, what am I doing?' So he says, 'Well, something bad happened and you keep going back to see if you can fix it or somehow make it right'. And I sat there and I said, 'That is what I'm doing'. And he said, 'You can't'."

---

From the introduction to 'The Wish' at the Christic Institute benefit, Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, November 17, 1990: "I wrote this song quite a while ago. I never really recorded it. It's a song about my mother. It was a funny thing because I had this song and I said, 'Gee, in rock music, in rock'n'roll, ain't nobody sings about their mother out there'.

"It's against all that macho posturing you have to do and stuff. I wanted to figure it out, so I went to see this psychiatrist. And I told him what the problem was. So he said he understood: 'You have to see all men are afraid of their mothers. They say a boy's best friend is his mother, but really all men are afraid of their mothers'. I had to pay for this, you're gonna get it for free. So I said, 'Well, men are afraid of their mothers, yeah'.

"That's why, when a man and woman get arguing, the woman's always going, 'Do I look like your mother? I'm not your mother. Am I supposed to be your mother?' Men are always going, 'Stop mothering me. Ah, my mother used to do that'. So realising the truth of this thing, I said, 'Wait a minute. I'm man enough to sing about my mother. I think.' So Mom, if you're out there, this better be good."

Introduction to 'Independence Day' at Brendan Byrne Arena, East Rutherford, New Jersey, July 9, 1981: "I could never talk to my old man, he could never talk to me, my mother couldn't talk to him. So I was glad when I finally got old enough and I started to live alone. Then for about ten years I never saw my folks that much. And just recently we came back from Europe and I got a phone call a night or two later that my father had gotten sick.

"And I went out to California where he was in the hospital there. I started thinkin' on the way about all the things that I always wanted to say to him and I never said and I always figured, well, someday we'll sit down and we'll talk about why it was the way it was when I was young, talk about why he felt the way he did. But the years go by and it never comes up. I guess it feels like a dangerous subject or something. But he got sick and I realised that he was gettin' old and that if I had somethin' to say to him, I should say it now "

---

Introduction to 'My Hometown' at the Christic Institute benefit, Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, November 17, 1990: "The thing of having a baby, you know, you're waiting and you're waiting. Call the doctor. He says, Wait, wait, don't come down here. So we're waiting. We rented some movies, walked around Beverly Hills for a while. Finally, we go to the hospital and I'm thinking, "Okay, I don't wanna faint'. That's my main concern. That's disgusting, isn't it? Anyway, we get there and it's night, and it was nice and the baby came pretty quick.

"Took him home and it was amazing, because I seen the first time he cried, and I caught his first tear on the tip of my finger. Seen his first smile and cleaned his first shit. All those things I think you keep on doing, I guess. Tremors, we watched Tremors, to spiritually prepare us for the occasion."

---

POLITICAL Introduction to 'Nebraska', Christic Institute benefit, Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, November 17, 1990:

"This is a story about disconnection and isolation. I've always been fighting between feeling really isolated and looking to make some connection or find some community to belong to. I guess that's why I picked up the guitar initially. I spend enormous periods of time feeling very isolated. I guess this is a song about what happens when that side of you gets really set loose. And you don't feel the connections, and you don't feel what sense laws make or morality makes. And you're gone."

---

Introduction to 'The River', Civic Arena, Pittsburgh, September 22, 1984: "There's something really dangerous happening to us out there. We're slowly getting split up into two different Americas. Things are gettin' taken away from people that need them and given to people that don't need them, and there's a promise getting broken. In the beginning the idea was that we all live here a little bit like a family, where the strong can help the weak ones, the rich can help the poor ones.

"I don't think the American dream was that everyody was going to make it or that everybody was going to make a billion dollars, but it was that everybody was going to have an opportunity and the chance to live a life with some decency and some dignity and a chance for some self-respect. So I know you gotta be feelin' the pinch down here where the rivers meet." (When Springsteen finished the song he dedicated it to Local 1397, the militant Homestead, Pennsylvania, branch of the United Steelworkers Of America who had been resisting pay and conditions cuts.)

Introduction to 'Independence Day', Palais Des Sports, Paris, April, 1981: "I grew up in this house where there was never any books or anything that was considered art or anything. But when I got older I saw that my father, he quit high school and went in the army and he got married real young and picked up jobs where he could, workin' in a factory, driving a truck. And I look back at my grandfather and he worked at a rug mill in the town that I grew up in.

"And it seemed like we all had one thing in common and that was that we didn't know enough, we didn't know enough about what was happening to us. Like, I'm 31 now and I just started to read the history of the United States. And the thing about it is, I started to learn about how things got to be the way they are today, how you end up a victim without even knowing it. And how people get old and just die after not having hardly a day's satisfaction or peace of mind in their lives.

"I was lucky too because I met this guy [Landau], when I was in my middle 20s, who said you should watch this or you should read this. And most people, where I come from, never have someone try and help them in that way. So all I'm sayin' is, is try and learn, learn about yourselves, learn about who you are now. And try and make it better for who's gonna be comin'. Because the real future of rock'n'roll's only about nine years old today."

Introduction to 'My Hometown' at benefit for workers of closure-threatened 3M factory in Springsteen's hometown, Freehold, at Stone Pony, Asbury Park, New Jersey, January 19, 1986: "The marriage between a community and a company is a special thing that involves a special trust. What do you do after ten years or 20 years, you wake up in the morning and see your livelihood sailing away from you, leaving you standing on the dock? What happens when the jobs go away and the people remain? What goes unmeasured is the price that unemployment inflicts on people's families, on their marriages, on the single mothers out there trying to raise their kids on their own. The 3M company: it's their money, it's their plant. But it's the 3M workers' jobs. I'm here to say that I think that after 25 years of service from a community, there is a debt owed to the 3M workers and to my hometown."

From a formal statement for Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour, 1988: "When you're young and you pick up a guitar, it feels so powerful. It feels like you pulled the sword from the stone. But as you get older you realise that, although it can do a lot of things, there are also a lot of things it can't do. I used to believe that it could save the world, but I don't really believe that any more... As I've got older one of the things I've wanted to do with my music is somehow take that power that I got from those records when I was a kid and somehow put it to work in some nuts-and-bolts way. And I've tried to find out who the people are out there who are working in the trenches, who are taking those ideas and ideals – same ideas and ideals that I got from those records – and outting them to use in some pragmatic way."

Introduction to 'If I Should Fall Behind', Syracuse Carrier Dome, New York, November 13, 1992: "This is for Bill Clinton. Back in '85, I used to say "Nobody wins till everybody wins". but that's not true. There's people out there winning but a lot of others are losing real big. The election is over and this is for Bill... gotta wish him the best."
