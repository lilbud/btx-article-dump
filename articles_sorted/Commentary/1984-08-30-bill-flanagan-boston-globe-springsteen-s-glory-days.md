Bruce Springsteen is probably America's top rock performer. He may not sell the most records - although this summer he's close with a hit album and a hit single - but Springsteen has the greatest impact.

He recently sold out 10 shows at New Jersey's Meadowlands arena, more than 200,000 tickets, in little more than a day. That set a record for paid attendance at a musical event in the New York metropolitan area.

What sets Springsteen above his competition is a consistent personalvision, and the artistic ability to convey that vision to a large audience.

When Springsteen checks into the Worcester Centrum for two sold- out shows next Tuesday and Wednesday it will be his first visit to New England since 1980. Since then he has released two albums - "Nebraska" two years ago and "Born in the USA" this summer.

"Nebraska" is a bleak portrait of desperate lives and short fuses. The record's production was as stark as the subject matter: Springsteen recorded the album on a cassette deck in his home, accompanying himself on guitar and harmonica.

"Born in the USA", the hit studio-made rock 'n' roll album Springsteen released in June, is as energetic as "Nebraska" is dark. Yet the two records share one spirit, a determined Americanism that suggests that the best days are gone, but a man has to grit his teeth and walk tall into the darkness.

Springsteen, a product of blue collar, small town New Jersey, writes and sings in the voices of people who cling to the American dream in spite of thedream's failure. The title song of "Born in the USA" is the story of a Vietnam veteran who, a decade after coming home, still can't fit into society or vent his frustration at having sacrificed so much for a lost cause:

```
Had a brother at Khe Sahn Fighting off the Viet Cong;
They're still there. He's all gone
```

Springsteen is a songwriter of depth and intelligence. His detractors miss this both because he is subtle and because he makes an effort to write in his own speaking voice, the voice of an ethnic working class American.

On Aug. 20, at the last of his 10 New Jersey concerts, Springsteen was greeted by American flags and by banners emblazoned with maps of the United States. He opened his show with a screaming version of "Born in the USA", and the crowd stood and chanted the title refrain like a pledge of allegiance.

Springsteen's Americanism is a tangle of conflicting emotions. But it was obvious in New Jersey that many of his fans identify it with simple jingoism.

Teenagers in the Reagan era, who barely remember Watergate or the fall of Saigon, whose first impression of US foreign policy was formed by the Iranian hostage crisis, don't share the 34-year-old Springsteen's memories of theVietnam era.

They don't even catch the irony when, after describing his personal and economic desperation, Springsteen's Vietnam veteran declares, "I'm a cool rockin' daddy in the USA." They just sing along.

Yet if conservative rock fans are off-base in using Springsteen's hits as marching songs, former hippies have probably been equally wrong in assuming Bruce is an old-fashioned rock 'n' roll leftist.

On Springsteen's 1973 debut album a song called "Lost in the Flood" described a Vietnam veteran returning home to find he no longer fits into the society he'd gone off to defend. In the Nixon era, it was easy to assume that Springsteen was mocking the soldier.

But when "Lost in the Flood" is listened to next to "Born in the USA", one realizes that Springsteen's perspective hasn't changed very much. What has changed is the context in which his work is received. The veterans in the two songs could be the same man. A character who seemed thick-headed, if not downright dangerous, in 1973 comes across as sympathetic in 1984.

On the cover of his new album Springsteen, dressed in red, white and blue, stands facing an American flag. The half-disillusioned patriotism that has always formed a sub-text to his work has finally emerged as a central theme.

Springsteen grew up in the youth culture of the '60s, but he was a hippie by only the most general definition: He had long hair and played rock 'n' roll.

Culturally, Springsteen seems to have had one foot in the teenage silent majority - the short-haired kids who went to Elvis movies, never touched drugs and giggled at the excesses of flower power.

Springsteen may have been a bohemian, but he understood the confusion his blue-collar peers felt as the counter culture's values took over their generation. In "Incident on 57th Street" (1973) he described the anguish of Spanish Johnny, a streetwise young man whose old gang was breaking up, abandoning their ethnic and social traditions to join the Woodstock culture:

```Those barefoot boys they left their homes for the woods Those little barefoot street boys, they said homes ain't no good They left the corner, threw away all their switchblade knives And kissed each other goodbye

```

Springsteen has often cast a sentimental eye on the passing of old values and old times. He has bid a farewell to childhood in "The Angel" ('73) and "Used Cars" ('82). He says goodby to a childhood friend in the new "Bobby Jean." He even makes fun of his own sentimentality in another new tune, "Glory Days."

The soldier in "Lost in the Flood" found all the old tenets of society - patriotic, social and religious - swept away by the '60s. Springsteen's warning that the veteran was standing in quicksand now seems less a chastisement than a warning. In "Hey, Santa Anna", an unrecorded song from the same era, Springsteen described standing by the Alamo, wondering that, in the post-Vietnam era, soldiers were viewed as cliches, even jokes:

```No more coronations Some punks idea of a teenage nation Has forced Santa Anna to change his station From soldier to cartoon

```

On "My Hometown", the closing song of "Born in the USA", Springsteen ties his sentimentality into his bigger state of the union message. Inthat song a father is forced by the changing economy to abandon his decaying northeastern home for the Sunbelt.

In New Jersey, playing to a hometown crowd, Springsteen declared, "I guess everybody, at some point in their lives, ends up in a love/ hate relationship with the town they grew up in. To admit you're a part of somethingmeans you're responsible for what happens to it. Well, this is our town, this is our state.

This is our country. We all share in the shame and the glory of the best and the worst of it."

At the show's finale he shouted to the cheering crowd, "Let freedom ring!"
