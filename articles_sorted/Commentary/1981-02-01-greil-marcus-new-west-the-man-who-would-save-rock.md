LAST OCTOBER Bruce Springsteen released his fifth album, The River, which went swiftly to number one in the States, and began a tour that will take him and the E Street Band across the length and breadth of the United States, into Canada, to Great Britain, to Europe, Japan and Australia. As interesting as this event is its context.

Rock'n'roll is, today, too big for any center. It is so big, in fact, that no single event – be it Springsteen's tour or Sid Vicious's overdose – can be much more than peripheral. Writing in August 1977, Lester Bangs may have got it right: "We will never again agree on anything as we agreed on Elvis."

Rock'n'roll now has less an audience than a series of increasingly discrete audiences, and those various audiences ignore each other. With the exceptions of disco in the US and reggae in the UK, blacks and whites have not had so little to do with each other musically since the early'50s when rock'n'roll began – and those exceptions are linked to the emergence of hip racism in the US (many discos that play black music "discourage" the patronage of blacks) and of organized racism among youth in the UK. The audience that has gathered around punk and post-punk groups may have a grip on the formal history of the music – the account, as written by white critics, of the music's pursuit of new forms and new ideas – but that pursuit has never had so little to do with what most rock consumers actually hear or, for that matter, what they've heard of.

In one sense, this is salutary and inevitable. The lack of a center means the lack of a conventional definition of what rock'n'roll is, and that fosters novelty. Rules about what can go into a performance and, ultimately, about how and what it can communicate are not only enforced, they're often invisible, both to performer and audience. That rock'n'roll has persisted for so long, and spread to such diverse places, precludes its possession by any single generation or society – and this leads not only to fragmentation but to a vital, renewing clash of values. We agreed on Elvis, after all, because he was the founder, because he represented the thing itself; if we will never agree on anyone as we agree on Elvis, it's equally true that Americans have never agreed on anyone as they agreed on George Washington.

But this state of affairs is also debilitating and dispiriting. The fact that the most adventurous music of the day seems to have taken up residence in the darker corners of the marketplace contradicts the idea of rock'n'roll as an aggressively popular culture that tears up boundaries of race, class, geography and (oh, yes) music. The belief that the mass audience can be reached and changed has – until now – been the deepest source of the music's magic and power.

The music does not now provide much evidence that this belief is based on anything like reality, and on a day-to-day basis this means there is no longer common ground for good rock'n'roll conversation. Bands with very broad – or at least very big – audiences continue to exist, of course, but they don't destroy boundaries; they disguise them, purveying music characterized principally by emotional vapidity and social vagueness.

- A CONCERT by Bruce Springsteen offers many thrills, and one is that he performs as if none of the above is true. The implicit promise of a Bruce Springsteen concert is that This Is What It's All About – This Is The Rock.

Whether the promise is more than a night's happy illusion is, at the time, less important than whether Springsteen can live up to it.

As songwriter, singer, guitarist and bandleader, he appears at once as the anointed successor to Elvis Presley and as an imposter who expects to be asked for his stage pass his show is, among other things, an argument about the nature of rock'n'roll after 25 years. The argument is that rock'n'roll is a means to fun that can acknowledge the most bitter defeats, that it has a coherent tradition which, when performed, will reveal possibilities of rock'n'roll the tradition did not previously contain.

Having posited a tradition, Springsteen performs as if every bit of it is backing him up – rooting for him. This allows him to hit the boards as if his status as a rock'n'roll star is both privileged and ordinary, and the result onstage is a unique combination of authority and prank. It means that at his finest Springsteen can get away with almost anything, stuff that coming from anyone else would seem hopelessly corny and contrived – and that he can come up with stuff to get away with that most rockers since Little Richard would be embarrassed even to have thought of. Such as, in Portland, under the brooding eye of Mount St. Helens, singing 'On Top Of Old Smokey'.

Two nights later, on October 27 in Oakland, the best seat in the house – front row on the center aisle – was the prize of a small blonde woman, a 33-year-old attorney from San Francisco named Louisa Jaskulski. She spent the first hour and a half of the concert dancing in front of her chair – nothing fancy, just the sweetest, most private sort of movements, the kind of dance one might do in front of a mirror. She was so expressive she seemed to add a dimension to every song, and early into the second half of the concert Springsteen responded in kind. He leaped from the stage and, with a gesture of gleeful courtliness, offered Jaskulski his arm, whereupon the two cakewalked up the aisle to the astonishment of everyone in the arena. This wasn't Elvis bestowing a kiss on a lucky female, who then, according to the inescapable script, collapsed in tears like a successful supplicant at Lourdes; prancing down that aisle, Springsteen was not a star and Jaskulski was not a fan. They were a couple.

An hour later Springsteen almost topped that moment. Introducing the band just before heading into 'Rosalita', he added a touch to his usual obeisance to Clarence Clemons, the enormous, splendidly decked-out black saxophone player: "King of the World...Master of the Universe... and... the Next President of the United States!" In two seconds it seemed like an obvious thing to do; one second before that it had been a shock so delicious it almost justified the presidential campaign which was then reaching its peak. Then, hard into 'Rosalita', Springsteen and the band reached that point when the song hangs in the air – when the pace is most fierce and the question of weather our hero well get the girl most in doubt. At the precise moment when the tension almost cracks the song in half, Springsteen turned to Clemons and kissed him square on the lips.

On Halloween night in Los Angeles, fog covered the stage. Six crew members, dressed as ghouls, brought out a coffin. Springsteen emerged and sang 'Haunted House', a 1964 hit by a deservedly obscure rockabilly singer called Jumpin"

Gene Simmons. Don't cringe – it could just as well have sung 'Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead', a 1939 hit by The Munchkins.

The night after Reagan's election, in Phoenix, Springsteen did not introduce Clarence Clemons as the next president of the United States. Instead, he walked onstage and said, "I don't know what you thought about what happened last night. I think it's terrifying." Then he sang 'Badlands', the most appropriate song he had to offer – for the time being.

As Jon Landau, now Springsteen's manager, wrote in 1968, an awareness of the Vietnam War could be felt all through Bob Dylan's John Wesley Harding; it is an almost certain bet that the songs Springsteen will now be writing will have something to do with the events of November 4. Those songs likely will not comment on those events; they will, I think, reflect those events back to us, fixing moods and telling stories that are, at present, out of reach.

Not many rock'n'rollers can be expected to react on this level. If Springsteen is able to do so, it will be least in part because of his evident conviction that whether or not rock'n'roll has a center, someone must act as if it does.
