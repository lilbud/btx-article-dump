Bruce Springsteen never intended to release a 1982 song titled "Murder Incorporated." A persistent fan made him do it.

"For years, there's this guy that's been following me around with a 'Murder Incorporated' sign", the rocker said in Sunday's New York Times. "I see him in the audience, like every five shows. I have never played the song, ever, in concert and would have no intent to do so, and yet this guy follows me around with this sign."

So when Springsteen made his "Greatest Hits" album, he included the song, which has been circulating for years on bootleg recordings.

"We said, 'Let's put this on for that guy, whoever he is', " Springsteen said.

A wise move. The song, about the proliferation of guns and the devaluation of human life, has become the first hit on Springsteen's latest album.
