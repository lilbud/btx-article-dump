Rock stars in sleazy bar settings.... Lustful guys ogling barely dressed gals.... There ends the similarity between two of this months's most popular music video clips: Bruce Springsteen's thoughtful "One Step Up" and INXS' dully exploitative "Devil Inside."

And therein lies the crux of rock's never-ending struggle to reconcile the need to grow up with the desire to indulge in juvenilia forever.

Springsteen's video treats its subject matter with maturity and even sadness-- finding no joy in the bar the protagonist visits, or in his fantasies about cheating on his wife with one of the joint's go-go dancers.

If Springsteen's character drifts in and out of his sexual dream world and comes back to cold reality, INXS' video never exists outside of a fantasy nightclub world where no one could entertain the temptation of "cheating" because no one could ever possibly entertain the thought of marriage in the first place. Teenland, in other words.

Springsteen really is willing to confront the devil inside; INXS, meanwhile, just takes one step down and one step out.

CLIPS PICKED TO CLICK:

Bruce Springsteen's "One Step Up." (Director: Meiert Avis.) Like many videos, "One Step Up" early on features the sight of a barely dressed young woman; unlike most such videos, in this one she's not the dominant visual motif.

Rather, it's the wedding ring on Springsteen's finger--seen as he sets his drink down in the bar where the woman is dancing, and seen again repeatedly as a silent reminder of spiritual betrayal when he fantasizes about that same hand touching bare skin, presumably not that of his wife. One of the scarier parts of the Tunnel of Love.
