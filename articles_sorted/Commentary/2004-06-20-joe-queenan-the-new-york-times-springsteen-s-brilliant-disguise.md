ON his dyspeptic 1983 album, "Trouble in Paradise", Randy Newman recorded a song in which Bruce Springsteen confesses that he is tired of being "the Boss." So he asks Mr. Newman, that sardonic singer-songwriter, if he would briefly fill in as America's most beloved working-class hero. This is one of the few instances in pop-cultural history where anyone dared to poke fun at the sanctified Mr. Springsteen, where anyone had the nerve to take the mickey out of the Boss and his studiously manicured image as the poet of the proles.

Recording "My Life Is Good" was the kind of jaundiced, disrespectful gesture that has long made Mr. Newman an outcast at life's rich feast. Making fun of the Boss was like snickering during a Holy Communion service, like plopping down on a whoopee cushion during a State of the Union address. Was Mr. Newman not aware that ridiculing Bruce Almighty, at least in the minds of white baby boomers, was like sneering at Mom, apple pie and the American flag? Was Mr.

Newman not aware that lines like "At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines" rivaled T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams for symbolic nuance and verbal ingenuity? Was Mr. Newman not aware that yea, verily, Mr. Springsteen sat at the right hand of the Father? What was wrong with this guy?

These thoughts are occasioned by "Springsteen: Troubadour of the Highway", a very serious, very portentous, generally yuck-free exhibition that pays homage to New Jersey's beloved poet laureate. The traveling exhibit is now at the Newark Museum through Aug. 29, and includes videos, memorabilia and more than 70 photographs by artists as varied as Annie Leibovitz, Frank Stefanko and David Rose; 41 of the photos are by Mr. Springsteen's kid sister Pamela.

Promotional materials on the museum's Web site ([www.newarkmuseum.org](http://www.newarkmuseum.org/)) say the show "explores Springsteen's use of cars and highways as motifs in his music and in related visual imagery" in much the same way that Raphael once used religious iconography in his work. The publicity materials continue: "From his songs 'Thunder Road' to 'The Ghost of Tom Joad', and at every point along the way, Bruce Springsteen has employed images of cars and the highway as central features of his music. His restless characters are on the move, sometimes on the hustle and often on the run. Speeding off the edge of town, down the Jersey Turnpike, or across the desert, their physical movement matches their psychic and spiritual searches. His images work as metaphors for Springsteen's meditations on both the promise and disappointments of America."

Oddly, the museum does not mention that Mr. Springsteen's father was a bus driver, which may explain the singer's metaphorical obsession with vehicles that can attain prodigious speeds without the encumbrance of making frequent stops, as this would impede his characters' psychic and spiritual searches.

Nor does it mention that you kind of need a car to get around in suburban New Jersey, as public transportation is at a premium, further illuminating the Boss's fixation on automobiles. But that is the subject for another show, perhaps one with even more photos by his sister.

Many of the exhibit's photographs are widely known, like "Asbury Park" by Ms. Leibovitz and "Corvette, Winter" by Mr. Stefanko. But Ms. Springsteen's lesser-known images are a byproduct of the 1995 release of "The Ghost of Tom Joad." This was the lugubrious, commercially unsuccessful record inspired by Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath"; when Mr. Springsteen sings material from this album in concert, the audience generally nods off or takes a bathroom break.

This is where it might be advisable to bring Randy Newman back into the conversation. As a super-hunky (check out those forearms) Mr. Springsteen vogues down the ribbon of highway in his sister's photos, it is difficult for those of a Newmanian frame of mind to suppress a chuckle. Thirty years after he attained immense fame and fortune and bade farewell to down-at-the-heels Freehold forever, Mr. Springsteen is still working his Everydude act for all it is worth. The working-class hero who dumped the band that helped make him famous, moved to the West Coast and married a model, and then took up residence in tony Rumson, where he became bosom buddies with the late risk arbitrageur John A. Mulheren, who was once arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill Ivan Boesky, is still getting gussied up as a forlorn migrant worker who dreams of one day living on that mansion on the hill. This is inadvisable.

As John Steinbeck might put it: "Bruce: I knew Tom Joad. I created Tom Joad.

And, Bruce, you are no Tom Joad. Tom Joad didn't pump iron with risk arbitrageurs."

Inadvertently, "Troubadour of the Highway" captures the cognitive dissonance that characterizes the Springsteen experience. "Born in the U.S.A.", one of the Boss's catchiest anthems, is actually an anti-American diatribe deploring this nation's ill-starred endeavor in Southeast Asia. But nobody pays attention to the lyrics; even Republicans love it. "My Hometown" laments the closing of factories, even though risk arbitrageurs like John Mulheren are precisely the kinds of people who help get factories closed. A typical Springsteen concert contains several paeans to working stiffs, but the audience for these songs is largely affluent baby boomers and party-animal frat boys. Unlike Pete Seeger and Billy Bragg, who sing left-wing songs for a left-wing audience, Mr. Springsteen sings quasi-left-wing songs for an audience that really only came to hear "Rosalita." This is not an indictment; it is a fact.

This is not to accuse Mr. Springsteen of being a fake, but merely to indicate that popular culture thrives on some sort of healthy hypocrisy. It is a safety valve of sorts that lets the prosperous middle class walk on the wild side.

How many people shelling out $57 to see Mr. Springsteen at the Meadowlands last year have ever been anywhere near the Badlands? How many teenagers from Totowa have ever been within 15 miles of the darkness at the edge of town? At a certain point, most adults -- and all suburbanites -- realize that they cannot live rock 'n' roll lives, so they accept the nearest substitute: a rock 'n' roll attitude. They live tough, edgy lives, vicariously, through singers who live tough, edgy lives, vicariously. Let's face it: Who would listen to a bunch of songs about people torn between buying a Lexus and a Saab?

Mr. Springsteen's music, strangely, has spawned precious few imitators and almost no progeny. It's the musical equivalent of a Ronald Reagan stump speech: peppy, assertive, highly anecdotal, occasionally censorious, fiercely obvious. Whatever he started out to accomplish as a youth, when he first emerged as a poor man's Bob Dylan, Mr. Springsteen has perfected a thoroughly American sound that is as wholesome and reassuring as Lawrence Welk's.

But in the end, the genius of Bruce Springsteen is that he not only gets to sing songs like "Mansion on the Hill", but actually gets to live in the Mansion on the Hill. In fact, he gets to live in the Mansion on the Hill precisely because he sings about people who do not live in the Mansion on the Hill, but who like to buy records about people who would like to live in the Mansion in the Hill, but cannot afford it, so they live in Secaucus.

Here, we come to the central dilemma of pop music: How do you write about the plight of life's victims when you yourself have been in the highest tax bracket since the Ford administration? How do you deplore the false promise of the American dream when you are the very incarnation of it? Do you take a cue from the Rolling Stones and David Bowie and just leave the class warfare stuff alone? Or do you write from memory? Springsteen, for whatever the reason, has chosen the latter course. He lives in Rumson, but his heart is still in Asbury Park.

Gazing at Sis's cornball photos of big brother Bruce, one cannot help thinking that America probably needs some rigorous guidelines governing the donning of the proletarian alter ego. Faux proles should be forced to spend a month doing community service in a housing project where they could meet some real working-class people. Ex-proles like Mr. Springsteen should accept that there is a statute of limitations on the migrant-worker shtick.

Bruce Springsteen is a great star, and New Jersey (and the nation) is lucky to have him. But exhibitions like "Troubadour of the Highway" belong in the lobby of the record company (Columbia Records/Sony Music) that helped underwrite this exhibit, not in an art museum. Art museums, like it or not, are for serious people, not rock stars who like to get dolled up as migrant workers, the way Marie Antoinette and her frivolous entourage use to frolic as shepherdesses.

It is probably true that the highways are jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive. But there's no reason museums should be jammed with them.
