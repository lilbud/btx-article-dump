ROCK MUSIC in its 50-year history has inspired many degrees of love, adulation and awe. Yet among the ranks of legends and superstars, only two have received titles setting them beyond all comparison and competition for ever. There was Elvis Presley, 'the King', and there is Bruce Springsteen, 'the Boss'.

Springsteen plays Wembley Arena on October 27 as part of an integrated American/European tour bigger than any he has undertaken since his mid-80s glory days. It follows the worldwide success of his last album, The Rising, which re-established Springsteen as the most dynamic living rock performer and renewed his claim to be America's foremost modern folk poet.

The Rising is Springsteen's commentary on the holocaust of September 11, 2001 – perhaps the most powerful yet in any medium. His music has always celebrated the dignity, resilience and potential for heroism in America's blue collar class. On that engulfingly dark day, the valour of New York's firefighters, rescue workers and ordinary people in the street justified his faith many times over.

Released in July, The Rising also gave heartening proof that the pop audience is not irredeemably hooked on motormouth rappers and plastic-smiling Britney clones. In its first week, it sold more than half a million copies in the US alone and went straight to number 1 on the Billboard magazine chart as well as in Britain and across Europe.

In rock, the cerebral rarely co-exists with the physical. Indeed, performers of intellectual weight usually tend to be rather underwhelming live onstage.

John Lennon was never an exciting performer, racked as he so often was by self-consciousness or self-loathing. Bob Dylan can be wonderful in one show, hopeless in the next. But Springsteen combines the sensibilities of a poet with a superpowered energy that could make Mick Jagger, even James Brown gasp.

This ultimate superstar remains utterly a man of the people with his shabby jeans and simple plaid shirt, his guitar no grander than a scrap of driftwood.

'King' Elvis may have had his monarchical tantrums, but with the Boss there are no 'off' nights. Everyone leaves his concerts in the same condition, their blood aflame, walking on air.

I have an odd little personal Boss anedcote. In 1975, when I was The Times's rock critic, a record company PR sent me an early pressing of what was to become Springsteen's breakthrough single, 'Born To Run'. It was – and remains – an enthralling concoction, mixing the parodic energy of Punk with hommages to Fifties rock 'n' roll, street-corner do-wop, Phil Spector's 'Wall of Sound"

and Marlon Brando's The Wild Ones. Springsteen had just arrived in Britain for his first tour, but the PR was having problems in getting him any media coverage whatever. Would I, as a special favour, spend the day with him?

We met in a Knightsbridge coffee shop. Springsteen then did not have his later cleancut, boyish look: he was bearded, black-leathered and faintly sinister.

We discovered common ground in both having grown up in shabby seaside resorts, I on the Isle of Wight, he in Asbury Park, New Jersey. He also recalled his years as a jobbing guitarist, playing back-up to Chuck Berry who, perversely, would do everything possible to throw the band off course. 'We used to ask him "What songs are we going to play tonight?" He'd just smile and say "we're gonna play some Chuck Berry songs".' At the time, I remember, we were strolling through Harrods menswear department, where Springsteen paused to try on some balaclava helmets, in those days considered suitable wear only for Christmas carol-singers.

It was after that first British tour that the scruffy troubadour from the Asbury Park boardwalk became the most over-hyped rock star even America had ever known. In one unreal week, his face adorned the cover of both Time and Newsweek magazines, a feat rarely managed by the President himself. This in turn brought on a wrangle between managers and record companies which effectively took Springsteen out of circulation for something like three years.

It was not until the early Eighties that he came into his own at last, with albums like The River and Darkness at the Edge of Town that celebrated the American working man and spoke for the outcast and disenfranchised as no one had since John Steinbeck's great Depression novel, The Grapes of Wrath. It was unashamedly music for 'guys', but decent, loving, aspirational guys rather than the self-obsessed, vacuous nerds of Britain's subsequent lad 'movement'.

Its piledriving simplicity and optimism tapped into an old American vein, perfectly expressing a nation that had just begun to feel good about itself again after the variegated humiliations of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iran hostage crisis.

Its apotheosis was the 1984 album Born In the USA which sold 12 million copies, stayed on the British album charts for more than two years and saw Springsteen all but hijacked as a mouthpiece for the block-headed presidency of Ronald Reagan. 'Born In The USA' was to become a hymn of unthinking, beery patriotism second only to The 'Star-Spangled Banner'; in reality it was a good old Sixties-style protest song, expressing the disillusionment of Vietnam veterans at their treatment on their return home.

Likewise, the elegaic 'Streets of Philadelphia' was the first and most powerful anthem to suffers from AIDS.

After our Harrods visit, I never met Springsteen again and saw him in concert only once more – but unforgettably. It was during his 1984 Born In The USA tour, at New York's Dodger Stadium. More even than his music, I remember his extended chat with his 50,000-odd audience that somehow made each and every one of us feel like a personal friend, sharing a hot dog with him on the Asbury Park boardwalk. 'I hope you have a wonderful life', were his almost fatherly closing words. My companion that night, a hard-boiled London publisher, left the stadium with stars visible in her eyes. 'It's an amazing feeling', she said, 'to fall in love with a rock star again."

Though pop fashions since the Eighties have come and gone by the million, there has been no serious pretender to Springsteen's homespun crown. Now 52 and married to his former backing singer, Patti Scialfa, he lives quietly with their three children on a farm in Monmouth County, New Jersey, still firmly resisting all efforts to drag him into conventional politics. In one American writer's apt phrase, he is a 'slumbering volcano': you know that, whenever it comes, the eruption will be Vesuvian.

This present tour also sees the Boss reunited with his famous E Street Band, including Clarence Clemons, the most influential 'chicken sax' player since Boots Randolph, and guitarist 'Miami' Steve Van Zandt. Wembley concert-goers have been warned to expect 'at least a three-hour set'. They can rest assured that not a minute will be wasted
