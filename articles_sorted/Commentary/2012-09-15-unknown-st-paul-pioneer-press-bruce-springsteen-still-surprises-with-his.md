Note: The source listed for this article was The Washington Post and the author David Malitz, published November 10, 2012. I couldn't find that, but I found a near identical article credited to the St. Paul Pioneer Press from 2 months prior. Some words changed around but almost entirely the same. That article is the one below.

One reason fans keep flocking to Bruce Springsteen shows is that an element of surprise exists. Not just from tour to tour, but from night to night.

This is a rarity when it comes to arena-size concerts, where what people pay for is less a music event than a carefully choreographed production. When Madonna performs in Washington next weekend, she’ll put on the same exact show audiences saw a few nights earlier in Chicago and the same exact one they will see a few weeks later in Denver. Both Madonna and Bruce Springsteen come to the Xcel Energy Center in November.

The norm with most acts is to play the same songs in the same order and have the same pyrotechnic explosion at the same moment every night.

A Springsteen show is different. There are scripted moments, of course, but on any given night he could break out a song he hasn’t played in years. To give you some idea of what the Boss might play, we’ve put the setlist possibilities into categories and included possible percentages of the concert, below.

And lately, Springsteen has been trading basketball arenas for ballparks. His itinerary on the Wrecking Ball tour has included stops at Fenway Park (Boston), Citizens Bank Park (Philadelphia) and Wrigley Field (Chicago). The large outdoor venues offer a great opportunity to enjoy Springsteen.

**12 percent staples from 'The Rising':**
The Boss experienced yet another resurgence in popularity with the release of his 2002 album, "The Rising", which became the unofficial soundtrack to American resilience post-Sept. 11. Three of the album's best songs, the title track, "My City of Ruins" and "Waitin' on a Sunny Day", are set list regulars.

**16 percent every-night classics:**
It's great when Bruce breaks out the rarities, but there are certain inalienable rights that come with buying a Springsteen ticket. Hearing "Born to Run" is one of those rights. There's a 99 percent chance you'll hear a handful of other songs, particularly during the encore: "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", "Thunder Road" and "Dancing in the Dark."

**20 percent new material:**
Springsteen released his 17th studio album, "Wrecking Ball", in March, and his spring tour featured it heavily. At a D.C. performance in April, he played eight of the album's 11 songs. This second trip across the country is still technically part of the Wrecking Ball tour, but don't expect to hear almost the entire album; five new songs looks to be the norm this time around.

**24 percent almost-certainties:**
These songs aren't locks on the level of "Born to Run", but it's likely that on most nights you'll hear many of them. Of such tried-and-true favorites as "Badlands", "Rosalita", "Glory Days", "Hungry Heart", "Working on the Highway", "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Darlington County", one of them might not make the cut, but you can count on such classics making up about a quarter of the set.

**28 percent wild cards:**
For true Springsteen fanatics, this is where things get fun. Will he dig deep for "Atlantic City"? Maybe he'll take it back to the beginning with "The E Street Shuffle" or break out "Prove It All Night." Perhaps a fan with a colorful sign request will catch his eye and the audience will be treated to a real rarity. "In the past several years, Springsteen has been taking requests from the crowd. He has never been stumped", David Remnick wrote in a recent New Yorker profile. Springsteen usually will play a cover or two as well. You'll likely hear more obscurities in cities where Springsteen plays multiple nights; in single-show cities, the "standard" set list usually is the norm.
