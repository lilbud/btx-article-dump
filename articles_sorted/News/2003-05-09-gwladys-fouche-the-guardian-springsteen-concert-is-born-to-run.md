Bruce Springsteen's 50,000 sell-out Manchester concert will go ahead after a court ruling yesterday rejected local complaints.

The Boss will play at the Old Trafford cricket ground at the end of the month, one of only three UK dates on his European tour, after Trafford magistrates overturned Trafford council's decision not to grant a licence, following complaints.

But the decision is a blow to campaigners. Jack Buxton, who lives 700 yards from Old Trafford, told the court that living next to the cricket ground when bands were playing was "like listening to a rock concert in bed. It's a cacophony of noise."

Old Trafford's neighbours also complained of the loutish behaviour of some Oasis fans when the Manchester band played last September.

But Springsteen's promoter, Harvey Goldsmith, said: "[Springsteen] is in control of the music and very aware of the environment. The fans are over 30 onwards."

The Lancashire county cricket club's chief executive, Jim Coombes, said the club would suffer if the concert was cancelled. "The loss of the income would be in the region of £100,000 to £150,000."
