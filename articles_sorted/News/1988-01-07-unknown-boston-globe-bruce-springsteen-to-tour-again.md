NEW YORK - Rock star Bruce Springsteen will begin a tour of about 22 cities for his latest album in late February, a Columbia Records spokeswoman said yesterday.

No details were available for the "Bruce Springsteen Tunnel of Love Express Tour", a Columbia Records spokeswoman in New York City said, on condition that her name not be used.

Even though the "Tunnel of Love", Springsteen's ninth album, is largely a compilation of solo songs, the tour also will feature the E Street Band, the spokeswoman said.

In 1984 and 1985, Springsteen made a world tour for the "Born in the U.S.A." album. When tickets went on sale for that tour's concerts in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., New Jersey Bell reported that 67 million calls - 24 million more than on a typical day - were made by fans seeking tickets.
