Bruce Springsteen performed one of his most highly-regarded concerts just over 34 years ago at one of New York's least-respected venues. And now fans of the Boss can relive those glory days by downloading the show on his website.

There is a price to pay, of course, but it's worth every penny.

Springsteen's New Year's Eve 1980 show at the Nassau Coliseum went on sale on his website ([www.brucespringsteen.net](http://www.brucespringsteen.net/)) this week, with digital downloads available in multiple formats for prices ranging from $9.95 to $24.95. A CD copy of the show can be purchased for $23.

The show is famous among hardcore Bruce fans and has been widely circulated among bootleggers. But the sound quality of these downloads is remarkable and the performance is even better, with a setlist that even the most picky Springsteen fans could not be disappointed with.

The show – recorded at the Coliseum in the months between the Islanders' first two of four straight Stanley Cup titles there – opens with Bruce asking the crowd, "Are you ready to send out 1980?" before the E Street Band explodes into a wild version of the song "Night" off his "Born to Run" album from five years prior.

Springsteen on that night performed 12 songs off his album "The River", which he had been touring behind for three months at that point. Two prior shows at the Coliseum took place on the 28th and 29th of December. Several songs included on his live box set "75-85" were recorded during the Coliseum gigs.

The live version of Springsteen's holiday radio staple, "Merry Christmas, Baby" was recorded on this evening, with the Boss and his band also playing "Auld Lang Syne" just after he counted down from 10 to ring in the New Year.

Later, he performed "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" as the first of his six- song encore, which also included "Born to Run" and "Jungleland."

Other highlights include E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan playing a snippet of "Once Upon A Time in the West" as an intro the first-pumping "Badlands" and the crowd-pleasing "Rosalita" to close out the main set of the 38-song concert.

This particular show is considered perhaps the best concert ever held at Long Island's Nassau Coliseum, which is soon to lose its longest resident, the Islanders, to Brooklyn's Barclays Center. The Coliseum will be renovated and used for more concerts – though it's unlikely any will match the energy of the one Springsteen played there 34 years ago.
