LOS ANGELES: Miami Steve Van Zandt has been in Bruce Springsteen's band for over a year now, and also finds time these days to guide the career of Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.

When I saw him in L.A. he was clad in a baggy white suit and matching loafers, along with a tam covering his curly brown hair. Dressed to kill, he resembled a big city pimp. A far cry from the puka shells in the audience at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium that night.

Steve smiles when asked about the outstanding version of 'It's My Life', the Animals classic which has been worked up into a 20-minute mini-drama in Bruce's act.

"That was at a soundcheck", he remembers. "When we do a soundcheck we jam and mess around on songs by the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye and the Sixties English things. 'It's My Life' started there. Bein' the brilliant cat he is, Bruce put that rap in which was so revealing.

"We learned a lot on the Southern tour we Just did. We learned that Time and Newsweek cover stories are meaningless to people. These magazines make sense to the people who already know you or the small portion in big cities who respond to that. Down there it was very much Bruce who? It was especially rewarding when they were standing at the end."

Some people were turned off by the hard-sell presentation of Bruce and the E Street gang as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Did Steve think the deserved hype turned off some potential fans?

"I don't think it did anything except for the people who never saw the band live. Like Steve Stills, He said some pretty heavy things against us, and I know he never saw us in action. I ran into him and invited him down, and he didn't show.

"Once somebody sees the band they can't possibly not like it. There's a difference between recording and the live situation. The albums give you a chance to know the songs and lyrics, and then that's expanded playing live.

"It gives you a broader sense of who he is", he argues. "It would be kinda boring to see an identical record."

From their last L.A. appearance at the Roxy, pianist Roy Bittan has worked with Bowie, tenorist Clarence Clemons has acted in New York, New York, the Martin Scorsese film, and Steve is heavily involved with the career of Southside Johnny. With all this alternative activity, the band are still thick as thieves.

"Bruce is the best possible boss", he says, munching over a kosher dill. "He's hip enough to let everybody do their own thing, to express in other ways. All that does is make your gig better. When you go back to playing in the band it's like comin' home to foundation and security.

"We look like we have fun on stage 'cause we do. Ninety-nine out of 100 shows I enjoy as much as the audience. I think it shows up there. We're not playing baseball stadiums.

"People aren't spectators, they're friends. The people stay with us. We have a real loyal following. In anybody else's case two years between albums would have been a disaster because Bruce Springsteen isn't a household word.

"The people we play to don't like us – they love us. It comes from playing clubs and small theatres two years longer than the business would have suggested.

"Small places have created this thing other bands seem to miss when they go for the bread and the 50,000-seaters. That's cool. It doesn't matter to me."

Springsteen's is one of the few groups around today carrying on traditional rock and roll. "I don't wake up in the morning feeling I'm carrying on a tradition", Van Zandt smiles.

"We're a roots rock group. We're conscious of it. I'm doing things not innovative, but we're always modernising the situation as much as possible. That's one of the reasons we use Jimmy Iovine as engineer. He's the best. A contemporary cat. We get a balance between us. If I had it my way we'd do the records in mono", he laughs.

"I think it's a prerequisite that it's derivative. It's obvious where it comes from. I just worry it will be considered a throwback or an oldie. These words scare me.

"I go home and someone puts on the new Peter Frampton album, and I then put Sam & Dave's Greatest Hits on the turntable and I feel it was released yesterday. In Bruce's case, he's cool. He's innovative, and creative, and lyrically beyond any problems.

"Every night I hear him change the rap between songs. That's gotta happen. We're not robots or actors. Why write a song or play one if it doesn't change or no-one is getting off? That's why I never understood the top 40 trip.

"Every night you respond to something different. Tonight he mentioned Kingsley and Ocean Avenue in 'It's My Life'. I know where he's comin' from, but only 15 people in the crowd know where the f\*\*\* those streets are.

"But there's universal street corners, and no-one feels isolated or left out. The Stones used to talk about places in England (Knightsbridge in 'Play With Fire') and everyone could relate. Maybe it even added to it, not being a common place."
