Go back in time to 1975 on a hot, sweaty day in Arizona when journalist Bart Bull took Bruce Springsteen to the State Fair.

Could you think of a better place to spend a day with Bruce Springsteen than at a carnival? In November of 1975, following five months of touring and interviews in support of Born to Run, that's exactly where you could find Bruce and Miami Steve, at the Arizona State Fair, relaxing on a rare night off.

Bruce was in the middle of a three show stand in Phoenix, one of the first cities west of the Rockies where Springsteen found major acceptance. The shows were Springsteen's biggest paying concerts to date, thanks in part to an arrangement by Mike Appel to promote the shows themselves. When the band rolled into most cities on the Born to Run tour, they might take home three or four thousand dollars, but these three shows in Phoenix brought the band nearly $40,000.

Journalist Bart Bull was assigned to write a story on Springsteen in Arizona for the now defunct magazine Sounds, a Phoenix tabloid. He spent the better part of two days following Springsteen around, and his resulting story reads more like a camcorder home video than an interview. Bull captures a candid side of Springsteen rarely seen at any point of his career. The story itself was only seen by a few readers since Sounds couldn't make a go of it and folded.

Rather than interview Springsteen directly, Bull tells his story by recording how Bruce interacts with the people around him and describing the scene from a "fly on the wall" perspective.

In Springsteen's comments you'll hear some of the pressure of months of interviews and hype accusations starting to get to him. The shows in Phoenix were the end of the west coast tour, just prior to shows in Florida before the European tour. Also documented is an appearance by manager Mike Appel who tries to convince Springsteen to fly to Hollywood on what would be a few days off between dates, to meet with film producer Dino De Laurentis. Bruce was being considered for a part in the film King of the Gypsies, though as Bull so clearly captures, Appel's interest in the project is not shared by Springsteen.

Bull's writing has appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers and he's worked as an editor for both Spin and Details. This piece for Sounds was one of his first major pieces of journalism, and as such reflects the style of a young writer. Still, the enthusiasm of this article from 16 years ago captures what it was like to follow Bruce Springsteen around at a point in his history when energy and activity surrounded him.

The language and perspective that Bull captured here provide a virtual time machine back to November 1975. So buy some cotton candy, don't get taken by the barkers and join Miami Steve and Bruce Springsteen at the State Fair.

"Hey! Hey, where ya guys from?" This grizzled old carny, this guy behind the counter of the toss-a-dart-and-win-a-poster joint, with his face so full of steel grey whiskers you could sand a rough-cut pine plank smooth on them, he's looking across the counter at these young hotshots, two of them with ear-rings in their left ears and both of 'em acting like they never saw a poster booth like this one here in all their whole lives. "Where ya guys from?"

"New Jersey", the slick one says, the one in the powder blue suit and straw panama with the matching blue hatband.

"Hey, he-e-ey, compadre!" says Whiskers, stroking his red-veined protrusion of a nose in delight. "Me too! What city?"

"Asbury Park", rasps the one in the blue workshirt and still unwashed new Levi's. His voice and the carny's are marvelous matches in their chainbeaten roughness and in their equal shares of the dense Jersey patois. "The Pride of..." mumbles the kid with a blond ponytail who is leaning on the edge of the counter watching Bruce Springsteen, Asbury Park's favorite son, stretch over the counter and direct his dart at the poster he calls "the California one", a black-and-white beach scene featuring a young man in a bathing suit looking down at the tide spreading toward his feet.

"Hey", Whiskers grins, buffing his nose to a glossy sheen, "I'm from Union City."

"Awright", Miami Steve says, distracted, still astonished at discovering that all you've got to do to win a poster is throw a dart and hit it, even though all the posters are within an easy arm's reach. He has a suspicious, preoccupied grin, like a child who has been handed the key to the candy store and is waiting to be let in on the inevitable catch. He puts down his stuffed snake in order to shake the gnarled mitt Whiskers is extending in his direction, then he reaches up and pulls his panama low onto his brow and begins sizing up the posters plastered in front of him. Whiskers wets his thumb for traction on the slick surface of Bruce's California poster, then spins it into a tight tube and hands it over. Bruce grabs it and, waving it around him as though trying to ward off airborne aggressors, walks off into the glare of the Flying Bobs, as the sound system pumps out "Duke, Duke, Duke of Earl."

It's Wednesday, there's no show tonight and Bruce and his lead guitarist Miami Steve Van Zandt, and Don, the band's road manager, are at the Arizona State Fair looking for something to do, looking to unwind a little. Bruce was a bit disappointed at just two encores at last night's show, and now this Hollywood business. It's getting to be a real drag. "They got me going to California Thursday after the show", he tells the blond kid, "to meet some guy and then talk to him." Striding down the midway, walking his tough punk walk, a walk that fits him right in with all the other tough punks cruising the carnival, he is distinguished only by his pensive look and by the fact that there is a photographer with curly red-hair scrambling to get shots of this particular punk at the fair.

It's a slow and rainy weeknight in the final days of the fair, the asphalt aisles are wet and empty, and the carnies aren't pushing the goods the way they would if there was a crowd around. Besides, Springsteen and Don and Miami Steve – Bruce never calls him Steve or even just Miami, it's always Mi-ami Ste-e-e-eve – are easy marks. Miami Steve even falls for the one where you try to toss ping-pong balls into glass ashtrays as they swirl around a wading pool.

A genuine sucker's shot, one that nobody ever wins, except maybe that lantern- jawed cowboy over there, the one with larceny in mind who's looking surreptitiously from side to side, waiting until the carnies aren't watching, then leaning way, way, way over and...ever...so...gently...gently... dropping...Damn! But eventually he manages to slip one in and the carnies grab a big stuffed Saint Bernard and toss it back and forth to each other, chanting "Anothah winnah!

Anothah winnah!" and Tex is grinning so hard it looks like he actually believes he won it, like he truly believes he slipped it past them, like the carnies never even noticed. While they're yelling and tossing his dog around, ol' Tex keeps up a steady pumping motion of his elbow right into the ribs of his girlfriend so as to focus her attention properly on his moment of triumph.

Miami Steve notices all this action – or at least the last part, anyway – and figures this one has got to be his game. If a dope like Tex can win a dog, a bright guy like himself could maybe end up owning the whole concession. He plunks down his buck, gets his dozen ping-pong balls – the sheer number of balls ought to be a tip-off – and begins tossing. The frustration of watching the balls hit the ashtrays dead exact center and then bounce happily right back out again gets to him quick. He slips over to the kid in the ponytail, gets him to sneak him some of the balls that are rolling around beneath the counter. The ploy nets him a couple of extra ping-pong balls but no winners.

He strikes out. Less dejected than amazed at his lack of success, he hustles to catch up with Bruce, who's on his way to the screen machines.

They start with a duck-hunting machine, then move over to Anti-Aircraft, two gunners trying to shoot down planes as they jet across the screen to the sound of engines roaring and calamitous explosions. "We got it – this is our machine", chortles Miami Steve. "This is our machine, Boss!" The Boss is leaning back grim-lipped, trying to gun down the jet that just snuck by all that Miami Steve enthusiasm. Behind them, the game-trailer attendant is eyeing them impatiently and the instant the last plane goes down with a stuttering buzz, he lowers the trailer's siding. Bruce and Miami Steve are searching their pockets for more quarters, oblivious, but when the carny lowers the siding right on top of them, Miami Steve stage-whispers "Hey, I think they're trying to give us a message", and everyone starts looking for the way out. The carnival lights are going out.

Winding their way around the fairgrounds, on the lookout for some way out of here, they split into two groups. Up front, the redhead photographer and Miami Steve are engaged in a philosophical dispute at a volume level on the borderline between discussion and armed combat; Springsteen, Don and the kid in the blond ponytail lag behind. "I O.D'd on interviews", Springsteen is saying, scuffling his boot at an empty popcorn box. "Everybody wants to spend all their time talkin' about what we're doin'. All I want to do is do it, but it's getting harder and harder." His speaking voice is somehow identical to the pained Brando-esque voice on his records. It would sound affected if it didn't come so easily. Maybe it was an affectation back in some dim and insecure adolescence, when a skinny kid from Jersey first tried it on in front of his friends, like a new leather jacket, unstained and without rips. Now, all thoroughly broken-in, nothing could sound more natural.

The two small groups pass by a flag-draped stage where "Poncie Pone – TV's favorite Hawaiian cab driver" had appeared with his Royal Hawaiian Revue only a short while earlier. Outside the farm exhibition hall there is a wooden box painted to resemble an old-fashioned red barn, with a glass showcase in front.

On the other side of the glass resides a chicken, a hen who will, if a dime is shoved in the slot, take a few random pecks at the toy piano inside the barn.

Miami Steve spies Henrietta the Musical Chicken and looks over his shoulder to where Bruce is walking. "Hey", he shouts, "here's one of them chickens."

Bruce adjusts his hands-in-pockets scuffling to swing by the chicken's cage.

He passes with a few feet, looking hard, looking intently, but not stopping long enough to stick a dime in. "Those poor chickens. They ought to...in Jersey it's against the law to do that." He jams his hands into his pockets even harder, then begins to mumble to himself. Suddenly, looking up at Don, he says "I don't think I wanna go. Mike keeps telling me I gotta go, but I'll just get on some plane and go there and meet this guy and then get back on another plane. I don't think I'm gonna go." His boot heels are dragging across the fairgrounds.

"Okay with me", says Don affably. "You're the Boss." The exit Miami Steve has been leading them to is locked, so they detour through the flood-lit cattle barn, across fresh-swept floors smelling slightly of manure and sweet hay.

Hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched high, Springsteen broods, slowing only to look sideways at a big heifer who grunts as the Boss passes by. A guard lets them out a gate and they converge on the nearly empty lot where the car is parked. The discussion Miami Steve is having with the photographer has reached new and louder levels of convolution and Don has gone over to supply some reinforcement for Miami Steve, who is punctuating an important point by prodding the photographer with a stuffed snake. The kid in the ponytail says something to Springsteen about a hype. "Like I said, I O.D'd on publicity. I mean, I like it, I like to talk to people about my music, but it's getting to be so much, you know? I mean, after a while, the only people who read what a writer's got to say is other writers."

"But aren't you a writer?" the kid asks.

"Yeah, but what I'm doin'...it's like I'm here and that's all you can say. I'm doin' what I want – I mean, all I ever wanted to do was make records, have a band like this. I don't want all this other stuff, ya know?" His hands, which had been pulled from his pockets to illustrate his intentions, are jammed back in, and he rocks back and forth on the heels of his boots. The kid persists.

"But you're a writer too. It's not like you just went out and picked up the guitar and started singing. It's not like you never read anything..."

"Nah", Bruce cuts in. "I never read that much. Just enough to get the concepts, the framework, ya know? There isn't anybody, any names I could tell ya I dig, just some things. But I never really read that much, except in high school when they made me. I listened to records – that's where I learned, man."

The kid is having a hard time accepting that. "You mean you don't pay attention to the reviews, you don't..."

Bruce cuts in again. "Nah, man, I mean there's no way – if a kid hears an album he likes, he's gonna go get it. If he likes it a lot, he's gonna go grab his friends and make them listen to it, or go to the show and if it hits 'em, they're gonna buy it. I mean, they probably read the reviews some, that's what they're there for, really, so you can find out what's goin' on, but you can get into that stuff too much and then it slows you down, you can't do anything because you're afraid that somebody isn't going to like it. All that really happens is if people listen and like it. If they have a good time, that's all, that's it. I feel like, who cares, man, all these people talkin'. I'm just trying to let it pass over me. I'm me, you know? People are gonna do what they're gonna do anyhow. I can't stop 'em, but I ain't gonna try."

While he's been talking, a father and his family have all loaded into their Chevy Impala. The dad puts the key in and starts it, but then he sees something, gets out and comes around back where Bruce and the kid are. He bends over and pulls a cardboard sign – parking $ 1.50 – from his bumper where the attendant has abandoned it. Dad looks the place over, adjusts his suit, then walks over to the bearded guy with the earring, and in his best man-of- authority Dad-tone says "Here you go – don't you want this?" He hands Bruce the sign. Miami Steve and Don are over at the rental car, trying to rouse somebody named Saddhu from a deep sleep in the front seat. "Saddhu! Get up!

Time to go, Saddhu!" Springsteen stares a moment at the sign he's holding, and lets it fall to the ground, then steps over it.

By the next afternoon Saddhu seems to have at least partially regained consciousness. Miami Steve introduces him at poolside to a reporter in a blinding orange aloha shirt as "our cosmic advisor", and he looks the part.

Saddhu is stretched out in the Chamber-of-Commerce-pleasing November sun, and if the rosy hue of his skin is any indicator, he has already absorbed more than his share of solar energy. Cosmic Advisor to Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band indeed. He's wearing one of the Speedo bathing suits which seem to be the poolside uniform for all E Street Band members and roadies, and his hair is slicked back and blond, like a heavy in an early-Sixties hot rod movie. He appears to have fleshtone Clearasil rubbed all over his nose, as well as some white stuff smeared around his eyelids. The total effect is fairly sinister, like that of a snake with a malicious sunburn.

His first words to Mister Aloha – "Listen, the Boss is doing a little business" – then a nod in the direction of the umbrella-shaded table where Bruce and his manager, Mike Appel, are talking – "I wouldn't bother him right now..." – tend to support any sinister impressions. Mister Aloha transforms himself into one enormous obsequious grin. "Oh no, sir, nope, no-sir-ee, sir, you won't find me going over there and interrupting the mighty Mike Appel, former Marine, notoriously tactless and uncouth person and quick-tempered despiser of any lick-spittle scribes who should be so presumptuous as to enter his presence without proper certification and identification and authorization and registration, sir, no sir, not me, sir..." and the craven reporter does a veritable Stepin Fetchit tapdance over to the nearest chaise lounge. Leaning back with the relief of a Christian only recently delivered from some especially cranky lions, he exchanges benign pleasantries with Miami Steve and then hits him with a barrage of technical questions from some guitar magazine.

Miami Steve is hunched over a room service tray with a bowl of Sugar Frosted Flakes curdling rapidly in the early Arizona afternoon sun. He's telling Mister Aloha some fairly questionable stories of his musical past when Bruce walks over: "See, when I first met Bruce, he was playin' the guitar with the strings backwards. Yeah, he had 'em on the side facing his body. I told him, "Look, kid. You gotta put 'em the other way, so the audience can see 'em.' He says, 'Aw, what do they know?'"

Bruce is wearing a Speedo too, and a gold loop in his ear. He flops down and starts spreading oil over his body. He has the muscle tone of a former contender in the New Jersey Golden Gloves tournament, welterweight division.

He wasn't, but he makes for a surprising contrast with most rock'n'roller's pasty flab.

Saddhu looks up and offers the Boss some of his organic sesame seed cookie.

The offer is refused, with a small shudder. "He don't want none of that"scoffs Miami Steve.

"If he did, he might get as healthy as me", Saddhu returns. He puffs his chest out, arms stiff at his sides, in an approximated imitation of a Muscle Beach bodybuilder. "Man, when the sun turns me this color, I'm human..." His voice trails off as he searches for the right word.

Mister Aloha has it. "Dynamo?"

"Yeah, right, a human dynamo", and with that, he hurls himself into the pool.

Mister Aloha and Miami Steve go back to their guitar interview, and Bruce shuts his eyes and lowers himself slowly back into the deck lounge. Miami Steve is telling all about his first amplifier – "It was a little thing, looked like a radio, sounded great. Turn that thing up and get all kinds of distortion! I wonder what I did with that thing...Hey Bruce! Didn't I give it to you, that little amp I used to have?"

"Never gave me no amp", Springsteen mutters from behind closed lids.

"Sure I did. That was right after I taught you everything you know about the guitar, as I was just explaining to this gentleman here."

Bruce leans forward, lets loose a snorting laugh, with lots of jaw action.

They crank up and start talking about old times, reminiscing about one of Bruce's old bands, Miami Steve calls The Brucie Revue. "Man, it was big, it had everything. Girl singers, horns, everything."

After that, Mister Aloha, Miami Steve and the Boss just lay out in the sun and gas about old bands and new records, with an occasional interruption when one or another falls into the pool for a few strokes. Mister Aloha shows Bruce a review stating that Born to Run, his recently released third record is a concept album, sort of a secret narrative, with homages to the great production styles of the Sixties. "Nah, it wasn't no concept album"Springsteen says, growing quieter. "I was just..." He pauses. "It wasn't no concept album." reaches for an inflamed pimple nestled in the lower reaches of his chin whiskers, and touches it, fondles it. "See, when I write a song, I look at a theme, and then, maybe, I write another one, on the same theme, but a different side." He smoothes the hair away from the pimple. "If you're looking at the songs that way, I can see how you might think they make a story", he says cautiously, "but I didn't really mean it that way, ya know?"

"So that means the review was worthless", Mister Aloha asks.

"No", Bruce replies, hesitating, "I mean, I don't want to say you can't look at it that way. I mean, anyway you want to look at it, that's all right, I guess. It's just that I wasn't really trying to do that one certain thing with it." He stops ministering to his zit and begins rubbing more baby oil on his chest.

"What about 'Born to Run', the Spector sound, I mean you did it so well, it really recreates the sound", Mister Aloha gushes.

"Well", comes the carefully-phrased response, "no one can really recreate that sound." Bruce and Miami Steve recently attended a Dion session being produced by Phil Spector during which the Master unleashed a few sarcasm-tipped barbs in the direction of the Apprentice. Bruce is deliberate and respectful when he says, "You can't really recreate that sound. The things he does are so... anyway, we got he sound we were looking for."

Saddhu has made his way out of the pool, perched upon one of the lounge chairs, pulled some radio headphones over his ears, pointed their antennae toward the stratosphere and then, eyes closed, with a look of bliss beaming forth from his face, gone into a yogic spinal twist. Bruce is checking him out, the look on his own face mingling awe and amusement, when he sees Mike Appel coming. He shuts his eyes and leans back into his chair again.

Mike Appel is relatively large but he looks larger; square-shouldered, in his early-to-mid 30s, black hair layered into a Businessman's Trendy, he's notoriously brusque and outspoken. One business acquaintance says, "After arguing with him for months, I think he is beginning to respect me." He has been trying to convince Bruce to fly to Hollywood after his Phoenix concerts to meet film producer Dino De Laurentis and speak with him about a possible acting vehicle. As he comes close, Springsteen lifts boyish arms skyward and cries, "Hey, Mike! This is what you need. A little sun. You need to slow for a while and catch some rays."

Appel stands over Bruce, his arms folded. "I'll slow down in January. I'll take a little time off then."

"Nah, Michael, what you need is a little sun now. Maybe you should come to Miami with me and we'll..."

"What I need is for you to come to L.A. Maybe you should come to L.A and then we'll get you right to Miami and then you can lay around in the sun all you want."

"I don't think I want to go to L.A, Michael", says the Boss.

Appel repeats it tonelessly. "Ya don't want to go to L.A." A pause. "Well, I think you should go over and talk to this guy. I think it would be a great thing."

Bruce reflects. "Who is the guy again? What pictures has he done?"

"His name is Dino De Laurentis, he did...awh, what's the name...?"

Mister Aloha is ever-willing to be helpful. "He did The Bible."

Miami Steve, suitably, awe-stricken, turns to Bruce, "He did The Bible?

Listen, Boss, uh, maybe you better go see this guy, ya know? I mean there's no sense in getting him upset. Besides, maybe we can get a part in it for me. I'd be great as the Son of God."

The Boss is amused. "Hey, what could Kahuna be?" The band's name for sax man Clarence Clemons is the Big Kahuna. "Hey, I got it. He could be the Ark."

Appel gets in on the act. "Hey, I got the part for you", he growls, pointing at Miami Steve. "You could be Judas."

"Me!" howls the wounded guitarist. "I was gonna have 'em save that one for you." The words hang in the air too long.

Appel straps right back down to business. "I think you ought to go", he tells the Boss. "You leave tonight, get there tomorrow, and we'll have you in Miami on Saturday. Then you can lay out in the sun until Tuesday." His position is clear, Appel clears out. The Boss leans back once more, closing his eyes.

When he opens them again, Don has appeared to dole out Miami Steve's salary.

Bruce looks over to him, as he holds out the payroll book for Miami Steve's signature. "Hey, do you think I should go to California?"

Don looks over his shoulder for a moment, then says, "I think you should get on a plane for Miami tonight." He disappears.

Miami Steve invites Bruce to come along to Texas with him. Mister Aloha wonders what Miami Steve's up to in Texas. "He's going to spill, as it were, his vital fluids", says Saddhu.

"Nah, man", Bruce says, "I just want to lay out in Miami." He gets up and dives into the pool, swims a couple of laps, then returns. Mister Aloha, apparently not the most tactful person, carries right on with his interrogation. "Hey Bruce. What part did Jon Landau actually play in the new album's production?" Landau was brought in after Appel and Springsteen had spent months in the studio, producing only one single. "Did he show you what you were doing wrong in the studio or what?"

"Landau don't know nothing about the studio, man. He was just there to show us some shortcuts, ya know? Some ways of doing things that was easier. He don't know nothing about the studio, but he's a smart guy, Landau. Wasn't for him, the album still might not be out."

Next, the inquisitive Aloha wants to know if Bruce has some kind of explanation for his enormous popularity in Arizona. "Well, I dunno. I know the first time we came here, we did a great show, really hot. Then, the next time, we did two more, equally good. That's probably it." Ever since Bruce and Mister Aloha started talking irrelevancies, Miami Steve has been immersed in his Mafioso mystery book, but now he looks at his watch and lets them know it's time to get ready for the show.

The show that night is loose, the band sloppier than on either of the two preceding nights, but Bruce and the audience seem driven to entertain each other. Springsteen goes through his usual workout, losing roughly a gallon of sweat, demonstrating how he maintains his muscle tone. Every other guy in sight is wearing his slouch-hat Springsteen costume. ("Check their shoes"says Clarence Clemons. "That's how you know if they really got it together.

They gotta have mismatched shoes.") Grady Gammage Auditorium's second tier rocks nine inches as the balcony crowd bops. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright does the graveyard spin, and the band comes back for encore after encore.

Springsteen is confronted by cluster upon cluster of competitive coeds (Clarence indulged a little extra Wednesday night and gave a backstage pass to anyone who showed a pretty smile), and the cake celebrating the end of the tour ends up everywhere.

And when the party is over, the Boss boards a plane for Hollywood.

---

This is the Thursday show mentioned in the article, after which Springsteen flew to California. The tour resumed in Tampa, Florida, on November 10th.

November 6, 1975 Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ THUNDER ROAD / TENTH AVENUE FREEZE OUT / SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT / PRETTY FLAMINGO / SHE'S THE ONE / BORN TO RUN / SANDY / IT'S HARD TO BE A SAINT IN THE CITY / BACKSTREETS / KITTY'S BACK / JUNGLELAND / ROSALITA / DETROIT MEDLEY / TWIST AND SHOUT Held in the school's Gammage Auditorium. One of the more memorable – and best – shows of the BTR tour. There were phoned-in bomb threats received several hours before the start of this show – however, after some initial panic by organizers and the Springsteen camp, the police determined that the individuals making the threats had gotten their schedules mixed up – they'd been intended for controversial ex-Vietnam veteran Lieutenant William Calley's speaking engagement in Gammage the previous night. Springsteen delivered a blistering show and worked the crowd into a complete frenzy, so much so that the large, humanity-packed balcony of Gammage began visibly swaying during the final stages of the concert. It was later reported that school officials had nearly decided to stop the show prematurely, although a post-concert engineering report gave the balcony a clean bill of health.
