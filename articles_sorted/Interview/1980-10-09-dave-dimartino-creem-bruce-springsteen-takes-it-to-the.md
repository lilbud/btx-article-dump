All things good come to he who waits; he who hesitates is lost. For every stupid cliché there's another one out there equally stupid that means the opposite, a fact of life that nobody forgets as they grow older, and a fact that nobody out there should ever want to forget.

And so it is with Bruce Springsteen, who either waited or hesitated, according to who you talk to, and whose long-awaited 'comeback' means more to more people now than it ever did before. His comeback, of course, is The River, two discs of working class angst and fury no doubt already memorized in college dormitories and better homes throughout the country. 'The Boss' returns, the legions chant, and – this time, at least – they're right. Because Bruce Springsteen has returned: he's returned to doing what he likes best (playing) for those he likes best (his fans) with who he likes best (his band). And the fact that it's taken him so long to do it is, well, too bad. Because it's been worth it.

You could write a book about Bruce Springsteen. Face it, somebody already has Springsteen's long and glorious career has been huffed about ad nauseum in Creem, Rolling Stone, Time & Newsweek, radio specials, No Nukes reviews, 'Heroes Of Rock 'n' Roll' TV specials and places even your grandmother would notice if she really looked. And the fact that he's met such enthusiastic reception everywhere has probably become a bigger albatross around his neck than any quickie "rock 'n' roll future" quote could ever be, mainly because – as far as being set up goes — he couldn't be in worse shape. It's common knowledge: set 'em up and knock 'em down. The reason Bowie's tune ' "Heroes" "

has those quotation marks around its title says it all; there are no more heroes. Because nobody wants them.

Yet here's Bruce Springsteen, hero. Waiting to be knocked down. And he probably will be – critically speaking, it's too much of a temptation not to knock Springsteen at this point, with hordes of "BROOOOCEE!!"-chanting fans growing larger by the minute, a two-year wait between albums (this time without legal hassles) and a gnawing feeling that this James Deanish last- angry-man stance is beginning to reek of political conservatism and other things you'll probably be reading about elsewhere. And of course all this is bullshit.

'Bruce Springsteen' is a myth; Bruce Springsteen isn't. 'Bruce Springsteen' is responsible for the 'rock classic' (it wasn't) Born To Run; Bruce Springsteen put out a promising debut album, one flawed great one (The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle) and one all-out classic, Darkness On The Edge Of Town.

Ironically, Born To Run got the reception its predecessor deserved, though of all Springsteen's output it now sounds the most forced, not quite ringing true these few years later. Filled with West Side Story pathos ('Meeting Across The River', the worst song of the bunch), the album already sounds dated in a way E Street Shuffle never will; only 'Thunder Road' and 'Born To Run' escape the trap, remaining classics on the level of, say 'Rosalita' or others on E Street.

What made Darkness so great, ultimately, was the sheer durability of its sentiment. The emotions dealt with on that set – loss, pain and despair – have always been the most durable, especially when they're conveyed as well and as meaningfully as Springsteen surprisingly managed. It's what separates, for instance, the Jackson Browne who wrote 'Song For Adam' from the Jackson Browne who currently chirps about a Disco Apocalypse, or Van Morrison's 'Slim Slider' from most everything he's done since. Springsteen went into the studios with Born To Run's cheering fans patting him on the back and came out telling them that he had stuff running round his head that he just couldn't live down. And they loved it. But they would've loved Born To Run Part Two even more.

And you know the story after that. Two years later, here's Bruce Springsteen in Detroit again, this time touring to promote The River which, on this Thursday night, won't even be in the stores until the following Monday. It's very early into what promises to be the longest tour yet: almost a full year of being on the road, time enough for the unfamiliar songs the Detroit fans hear to become old favorites by the time Their Hero returns. Time enough for a lot of things to happen.

And it wouldn't be a Bruce Springsteen concert if it wasn't an endurance test.

As usual, though, it's Springsteen & his band who'll have to endure; this time almost four hours, with a brief intermission for the band while the audience in Cobo Hall refuels on beer and more. Their Springsteen concert is an 'event' in the way concerts by the Stones, the Who and even Led Zeppelin are: instant sell-outs, scalpers hawking tickets outside and smug looks on those inside who'll be telling friends tomorrow what they missed.

Wisely, the band begins with 'Thunder Road'. The audience stands, sings along, chants "BROOOOCEE!" at the song's end and, of course, loves it all. Old favorites continue; Springsteen knows the audience needs reassurance before he wheels out the new stuff that no one in Detroit's ever heard before. When he finally does, though, it makes no difference; still "BROOOCE!" The audience keeps screaming 'til four hours later, when the final score is 'Quarter To Three' and Springsteen struts offstage, ready for tomorrow night's encore in Chicago. Ten more months or so and it'll finally be all over.

Backstage, it's the usual. Local CBS man Mark Westcott is playing traffic cop, directing the flow of concert hangers-on, industry people and local radio celebs who've come back to "meet The Boss" and are wearing appropriate passes visibly on their person. And the fact that Springsteen is such a real-and-true Good Guy makes things even more problematic: he'd never dream of not facing his public, be it radio bigwigs or the little guys, cold and waiting outside at the stage door. Unspoken, but not unfelt, is the sentiment that if Bruce Springsteen ever dies it will be of terminal niceness, "He Was A Nice Guy" his perfect tombstone epitaph.

When we finally reach the inner sanctum, Springsteen's manager Jon Landau greets us. He smiles and says "No more than a half-hour, OK? Please?" making it obvious that, indeed, if Springsteen's niceness weren't enough, the guy also likes to talk, which in these days of Johns Lennon and Lydon is no small concern. Inside the dressing room, CBS man Westcott is finishing up presenting the radio royalty to Springsteen, and the man who, looked 10 feet tall and heroic onstage now looks merely shot, tired and diplomatic. "Nice to meet you all", he says, and he obviously means it.

Eventually, Westcott and crew leave, and the E Street Band is brought in for a series of quick Creem photos. "No point in keepin' these guys up", Springsteen says, and it's a quick reminder that the interview to come will appropriately take place at Quarter To Three in the morning. Some things, I guess, you just can't escape.

As the band cruises out, Springsteen shuffles over to a nearby couch, the room quickly empties and the tape recorder is turned on. A final Springsteen higher-up enters the dressing room, asks "Hey Boss, you want a soda or somethin'?" and soon leaves.

Thus I can't help but ask immediately: "You mean they all call you 'Boss'?" and Springsteen cracks up.

"Well the thing I have with this 'Boss' is funny", says he, his voice something out of Mean Streets, hoarse and filled with "dese"s and "dose"s."

'Cause like it came from people like that, who work around me. And then somebody started to do it on the radio. It's funny, cuz..." He makes a face. "I hate being called 'Boss.' " He laughs; we laugh. "I just do. Always did, from the beginning. I hate bosses. I hate bein' called a boss. Everybody says 'Hey Boss', and I say 'No, Bruce, Bruce!'"

We laugh again and sit back, and I regale the man who hates being called 'The Boss' with a story Bob Seger told Creem earlier this year. We'd asked Seger what the major delay had been with Against The Wind, and he'd started talking about song selection and balance, about him wanting the album to "feel right."

He'd told us he'd been watching Springsteen record The River. "You should see Springsteen", he told us. "He's goin' through the same movie right now. He's pullin' his hair out..."

"Yeah", Springsteen laughs, "right. Well, from the beginning I had an idea of what I felt the record should be. And I don't think... I'm not interested in going in the studio and ..." He pauses, considering. "I don't want to just take up space on the shelf, ya know? Or worry that if you don't have something out every six months, or even a year, that people are going to forget about you. I was never interested in approaching it in that way. I've never been, from the beginning. I just have a feeling about the best I can do at a particular time, ya know? And that's what I wanted to do. And I don't come out until I feel that that's what I've done. Because there's so many records coming out, and there's so much stuff on the shelves. Why put something that you don't feel is what it should be?

"And I don't believe in tomorrows, that 'Oh, I'll put the other half out six months from now.' You may be dead, you just don't know. You make your records like it's the last record you'll ever make. You go out and play at night – I don't think 'If I don't play good tonight at least I played good last night."

It's like, there are no tomorrows or yesterdays. There's only right now."

Heavy stuff, and more ammunition for critics who think Springsteen's approaching death via terminal romanticism – but the truth is the man says it and means it, for which he certainly can't be faulted. Sincerity doesn't play often at Cobo Hall and all that.

"Nobody's expectations are higher than your own. You do what you can do and that's the way it stands. People have their expectations, and I try to live up to a certain thing I feel myself. And I know I have strict ideals about the way we do things, the way the band does things. So outside forces play a secondary role. You know people's expectations are gonna be what they're gonna be – and in the end you're gonna disappoint everybody anyway, ya know?"

Creem writer Mark J. Norton mentions that he'd seen Springsteen a week earlier in Ann Arbor, the opening night of the tour. It was great, said he, that Springsteen actually forgot the opening lines to 'Born To Run', but the audience knew them and sang along until the stunned Springsteen suddenly caught on.

It brings up an interesting point: At this point, most of Springsteen's audience is literally fanatical – they know the songs, the albums, the band, and what to expect of a typical marathon performance. I ask Springsteen if sometimes he wishes that wasn't the case, that he was up against an audience that had absolutely no idea what to expect from him.

"I've opened for Black Oak Arkansas", he says, shaking his head. "I've opened for Brownsville Station, and I've opened for Sha Na Na. I'm 31 – and I've been playing in bars I was15. And I've faced a lot of audience that don't give a shit that you're onstage. And if you're calling percentages, we've had 2 to 5% total nights like tonight against maybe 95% in the 10 or 15 years we've been playing. Lemme tell you, that did not happen then and that does not happen now... And it keeps you from ever getting spoiled, because you know what it's like when nobody gives a damn when you come out there. It keeps you in a certain place, it stays with you. There's no free rides.

"When we first started playing, I'd go to every show expecting nobody to come, and I'd go onstage expecting nobody to give me anything for free. And that's the way you have to play. If you don't play like that, pack your guitar up, throw it in the trash can and go home, fix televisions or some other line of work, ya know? Do something where that's the way you feel about it. And the night I stop thinking that way, that's the night I won't do it anymore, 'cause that's just the bottom line.

"I don't gauge the show by the audience reaction, I don't gauge the show by the review in the paper the next day, I know when I get on the bus to got to the next town. I know if I can go to sleep easy that night. That's the way we judge it and that's the way we run it. And if we didn't it wouldn't be happening in the first place."

We start talking about albums and moods and I ask Springsteen the impossible – to tell me in a few words, what The River is all about. It is, in a sense, an overwhelming disadvantage to talk to Springsteen prior to actually hearing the album: as good as the songs might have been that were earlier performed onstage, it's hard to immediately grasp any overriding theme or concept. And yeah, there is an overriding theme or concept, as antiquated as that might sound, but The River, like Darkness before it, is based on the broadest concept possible – the human experience – which automatically makes it more interesting than four-fifths of the other records coming out today. Not that four-fifths of the other records coming out today aren't based on human experience, but can they help it if they don't sound like it?

I rattle off a rapid-fire analysis of Springsteen's LPs, telling him I thought both E Street Shuffle and Darkness were better records than Born To Run, if only for their consistency of mood. E Street seemed – and seems even today – happily nostalgic, for want of a better word, without sounding forced or smug.

Darkness was as depressing as its name, and what made it even more interesting was that it followed Born To Run and the whole success-story the thing. In retrospect, Darkness seems like the only sane reaction to the same story – and, thankfully, a very human one.

Consistency of mood apparently means much to Springsteen also; he cites it as the main reason for The River's interminable delay. "The main thing", he explains, "was trying to focus on exactly what I wanted on the album – as opposed to off, you understand – and what I wanted to do with the characters.

Like on Darkness, that stopped at a certain point. Well, what happens now?

"When I did Darkness, I was very focused on one particular idea, once particular feeling that I wanted to do. So this time, one of the things that I felt was that on Darkness, I just didn't make rooms for certain things, ya know? Because I couldn't understand how you could feel so good and so bad at the same time. And it was very confusing for me. 'Sherry Darling' was gonna be on Darkness, 'Independence Day' was a song that was gonna be on Darkness, and the song that I wrote right after 'Darkness' was 'Point Blank' – which take that thing to its furthest."

If you want to start talking about 'types' of Springsteen tunes, reasonably one can suggest there are two major kinds: happy, upbeat songs like 'Rosalita' and 'Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out', joyful Life-Is-Great-Now ditties, and 'sad', downbeat songs like 'Racing In The Streets' or 'Something In The Night', moving Life-Ain't-So-Great-Now ditties. The basics E Street Shuffle/Darkness dichotomy. And apparently Springsteen sees it the same way.

"When I did The River, I tried to accept the fact that, you know, the world is a paradox, and that's the way it is. And the only thing you can do with a paradox is live with it.

"And I wanted to do that this time out, I wanted to live with particular conflicting emotions. Because I always, personally, in a funny kind of way, lean toward the Darkness kind of material – and when I didn't put the album out in 1979 it was because I didn't feel that was there. I felt it was something where I just got a bigger picture of what things are, of the way things work, and I tried to just learn to be able to live with that."

So I'm gonna listen to The River when I get it next Monday and I'm gonna feel that paradox you're talking about?

"I think so", Springsteen says. "In the end, I think that's the emotion. What I wanted was just the paradox of those things. There's a lot of idealistic stuff on there, there's a lot of stuff that, hey, you can listen to it and laugh at it or whatever. Some of it is very idealistic, and I wanted that all on there. At first I wasn't gonna put it all on there, ya know?

"I saw it as romantic. It's a romantic record – and to me 'romantic' is when you see the realities, and when you understand the realities, but you also see the possibilities. And sometimes you write about things as they are, and sometimes you write about 'em as they should be, as they could be, maybe. And that's basically what I wanted to do, ya know? And you can't say no to either thing. If you say no, you're cheating yourself out of feelings that are important and should be a part of you."

We talk a little more about The River and the time it took it record it ("Believe it or not, I'm goin' as fast as I can", he says), and Springsteen says he didn't think there were more than 10 takes of any of the songs, most of them, in fact, being done under five. Again, he stresses; the larger portion of time was deciding which of the 40 tracks – that's right, 40 – he recorded should be included on The River. Word was, in fact, that just as the final version of the album was going to be pressed. Springsteen yanked it back in time to pull 'Head Up Without A Gun' off the album. Behavior which, if anything, seemed to indicate that true recording spontaneity – typified by the Go-In-And-Bang-'Em-Out mentality – was a concept totally alien to Springsteen.

Springsteen disagrees, somewhat vehemently. "Spontaneity, number one, is not made by fastness. Elvis, I believe, did like 30 takes of 'Hound Dog', and ya put that thing on... The thing is to sound spontaneous; it's like these records come out that were done real fast and they sound like they were done real fast. If I thought I could've made a better record in half the time, that's exactly what I would've done. 'Cause I'd rather be out playing.

"It's the kind of thing where... I mean, I know what I'm listening for when I hear it played back, and I just had particular guidelines. I mean the actual performances were done fast, but I think the thing that takes the most time is the thinking. The conceptual thing. It takes a certain amount of time for me to think about exactly what it is I wanna do and then I've gotta wait until I finally realize that I've actually done it."

A large part of Springsteen fandom, in case you didn't know, centers around bootleg LPs and tapes. Springsteen is probably the most widely bootlegged performer around these days, and the array of bootlegs – radio performances, rehearsal tapes and more – is especially interesting because Springsteen, unlike so many artists before him, once seemed to almost actively encourage bootlegging, figuring – quite rightly, for the most part – that nobody was being harmed in the process, himself included. Surprisingly, though, sometime last year he seemed to have changed his mind, actually taking a case or two to court to prevent further bootleg distribution.

"I remember when I first started out", he says. "A lot of the bootlegs were made by fans and then there was more of a connection. But it became... there was a point where there were just so many – just so many – that it was just big business, ya know? It was made by people who didn't care what the quality was.

It just got to a point where I'd see a price tag of $30 on a record of mine that to me just sounded really bad, and I just thought it was a rip. I thought I was gettin' ripped. I wrote this music, the songs – it all came outta me, ya know? And I felt it was a rip. And the people who were doing it had warehouses full of records, and they were just sittin' back gettin' fat, rushing and putting out anything and getting 30 fuckin' dollars for it. And I just got really mad about it."

Springsteen adds the plan is to release a live album now that The River's finished – which might explain his new bootlegging consciousness, indirectly or otherwise.

And I guess one of the biggest questions remains: does Springsteen anticipate any sort of critical or commercial backlash at this point with The River? It's been two years since he's last been heard from – time enough for even some of his oldest friends to turn their backs on him.

Springsteen looks doubtful. "That stuff happens all the time", he says.

"Besides that's happened to me already, I've lived that already. And it's the kinda thing that just happens. People write good things and then they don't.

The first time I went through that, it was confusing for me, it was disheartening. And I guess I felt that I knew what I wanted to do, and what I was about. It's just the same old story – where I was 25 when that first happened and I'd already been playing for 10 years. Now I'm 31, and I've been through that.

"When you first come up, and people start writing about you, you're just not used to it. It's just strange. There were a lot of things that brought me real down at the time, and there were a lot of things that brought me real up. I was very susceptible to being immediately emotionally affected by something like that at the time. But like I went through it, I saw it happen, I saw how it happens. I was younger then, and much more insecure. I hadn't put the time in that we've put in since then. I've seen all sides of the music thing and now – whatever happens now is only gonna be a shadow of that moment, ya know?

"So if a lotta people wrote a lotta good stuff and then they wrote a lotta bad stuff – whatever happens, it happens. You have a concern about it, 'cause I spent a long time and you put a lot into doing a record. It's the same ol' story, anybody who says it ain't a heartbreaker, it ain't true, ya know?"

He laughs.

"But that's the way things are, ya know? And I'm at a point where I've got a better perspective about a lot of these things."

We've already flipped the C-90 over which means it's been over 45 minutes and Springsteen keeps talking, obviously exhausted, but determined to answer all our questions. In all decency, we can't ask any more without overstaying our welcome; ironically though, the last question we ask might easily have been the first. It's certainly the most basic. We ask Bruce Springsteen if he's happy. Happy with his music, his life and himself. His answer: "Yeah. 'Cause if I felt that if I was just sitting there and squeezing the life outta the music, I wouldn't do it. But that's not what happens, that's not what we do. The physical act is not what takes the time – I mean, this was our fifth album, and when we rented the studio we knew how to make a record. As fast or slow as we wanted to, right? The physical thing is not the story. Just how you feel inside about it. And that don't run on any clock. Just how you feel inside, just where you are today and what your record is gonna be says out there, and what the people that buy that records are gonna feel and get from it.

"And I had an idea, and I wasn't gonna go halfway with it. Wasn't a point in it. Like I said, I don't trust no tomorrows or that kind of thing. And I'd rather do the time – and the time is no fun to do – 'cause if I didn't do the time there, I couldn't walk out there on the stage.

"We're gonna be playing a lot of shows, and we're just gonna be out there for a real long time. And when I go out there at night, I just like to feel... like myself. And like I've done what I have to do. And when I play those songs onstage, I know those songs, I know what went into 'em and I know where I stand. And people will like it and people will not like it, but I know that it's real. I know that it's there."

When we finally leave Cobo Arena, it's four in the morning and the Springsteen crew is boarding various busses, readying for the five-hour drive to Chicago. As we close the stage door behind us, we see 30 or so fans outside, copies of Born To Run and Darkness in hand, all waiting in this early morning hour for a glimpse of and maybe a quick conversation with Springsteen. The fans wait, we leave, and it's a sure bet that much later, when a tired Bruce Springsteen opens the backstage door, he'll have 30 more conversations waiting for him before he finally makes it to his bus. And Springsteen, no doubt, wouldn't have it any other way.
