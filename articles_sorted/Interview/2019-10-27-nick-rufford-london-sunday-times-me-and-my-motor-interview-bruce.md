"My style behind the wheel was considered inept and reckless by the band"

After four decades of rockin' and rollin' and the sale of 135m albums, Bruce Springsteen could afford a fleet of limousines, yet his car collection is as modest as the man and as blue-collar as his music.

Stashed away in outbuildings on his 300-acre farm in New Jersey are "a few American cars from back in the day". By that, he means some beautiful American classics from the 1960s and '70s — plus some motorcycles, including British machines. He tinkers when he gets the chance and uses them as often as he can.

"I have a garage full of cars that I've collected over the years", he says.

"They're not collector's pieces; they're what I call drivers. I have my original Corvette. I've got a '69 Chevy. I've got a Cadillac. I've got an old pick-up truck. I've got a small collection of older American vehicles that I get in and drive once in a while."

Most of the cars have a story to tell. The 1960 Corvette is on the cover of his autobiography Born to Run. The '69 Chevy features in one of his best-loved songs, Racing in the Street. In classic Springsteen style, it's about a man trying to escape from his problems and his mundane life by racing cars at night.

The singer is also an aficionado of two-wheeled machines, a passion he revived later in life. He'd stopped riding in his teens after being concussed in an accident, when a '63 Cadillac T-boned his small Yamaha in 1967.

"I started riding again in my thirties", he says. "So for the past 30 years I've put together a small collection of bikes in my garage. I have one vintage Triumph Trophy and a Thunderbird from '94. I've got a more modern Triumph, a kind of a souped-up Bonneville. And I've got a new Norton 961 Commando. Then I have my old Harleys."

Springsteen also keeps some modern 4x4s for getting around his property. "Just for daily drivers we have Jeeps — Cherokees — and a Range Rover", he says.

Since his 1973 debut album — Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ — cars have helped to power his lyrics, often as a metaphor for escaping smalltown America.

"[Cars] continue to be, for me, resonant and romantic and I think the idea of a journey is always compelling to people", he says today. "The image of driving is just very evocative for people. It's a geography that I like to say all people carry inside them. Those images are images that people have internalised through films and travel over the years."

In Western Stars, a feature-film companion piece to his recently released album of the same name, Springsteen says: "We still live a lot of our lives, here in America, in cars, just trying to get from one place to another. I suppose 40 years ago they were a potent metaphor for open roads and freedom.

Over the rise, around the bend, into the future. And to settle the spirit sometimes."

The film shows Springsteen in concert, not in his usual stadium setting but in an old barn on his ranch. Between songs we see clips of Super 8 footage of a younger Springsteen, and sequences of him against a backdrop of big skies and wild horses. He provides the voiceover, summoning up homespun philosophy about life and love, struggle and reward. Some of the homilies are delivered from the driving seat of an antique Chevrolet El Camino as he travels through a parched landscape in Joshua Tree national park.

Given that his music is so deeply rooted in car culture, it's all the more surprising that he wrote those early songs when he didn't have a licence and barely knew how to drive. Springsteen, 70, jokes he was something of a fraud in those days, composing lyrics about cars when he didn't own one and singing about factory work when he'd never done a day's manual labour.

His first experience behind the wheel was so hair-raising that it's surprising it didn't kill off his affection for automobiles — not to mention Springsteen himself. He took turns driving a friend's truck on a three-day journey from New Jersey to Big Sur in California. He and his bandmates had been booked for a gig and couldn't afford to turn it down, even though it was 3,000 miles away. The ancient wagon had a dilapidated gearbox. He recalls in his 2016 autobiography: "I just drove — no licence, no permit, no experience. The truck was an old manual shift. You had to clutch, shift, clutch, shift, the engine begging for mercy."

He still couldn't drive when he toured with the E Street Band in 1973 to promote Greetings. "Everyone but myself took turns driving. I still had no licence and my style behind the wheel was considered inept and reckless endangerment by the band."

Even when, in 1974, he wrote Born to Run, the album that shot him to international stardom, he still owned no car. He bought his first the following year, aged 26, for $2,000. It was a 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air convertible, with flame detailing on the bonnet and a "Hurst on the floor"

(echoing the lyric in Racing in the Street about that kind of gearlever).

As album sales took off, he could finally afford the set of wheels he'd always wanted, buying it in New Jersey from a worker at an ice cream stand. "Born to Run had earned me a Steinway baby grand piano and a 1960 Chevrolet Corvette I bought for six grand from a kid behind the counter", he recalls.

He was delighted when, as a thank-you gift for writing Gary "US" Bonds's comeback hit song This Little Girl, Bonds bought him a classic 1963 Chevrolet Impala convertible, another American land yacht.

So in love was he with Americana — and cautious with money — that for years he wasn't interested in buying a new car. He records in his memoirs: "I'd never owned a new car in my life. For that matter, I'd never spent $10,000 on myself. Still I bit the bullet, rode down to the dealer and drove away in a 1982 Chevy Z28 Camaro. I felt as conspicuous as if I were driving a solid gold Rolls-Royce."

Even after he'd bought it, he still hankered after the old classics: American barges, redolent of long, straight roads stretching across the desert towards the horizon. When he acquired a house in the Hollywood Hills, he needed a car to cross the continent, so he bought "for a few grand" a 1969 Ford XL "with a white ragtop, sea green and Cadillac long". It was the perfect road trip car with Jack Kerouac On the Road cool, Springsteen recalls.

Only when he started a family with Patti Scialfa, a singer with the E Street Band, did he succumb to a more practical form of transport — a minivan — for transporting his children, Evan, Jessica and Sam. Indeed, he would often ferry them and their friends to sports matches, along with their kit, sometimes to the surprise of other parents, who would do a double take when they saw a rock star acting as taxi driver and roadie.

Cars feature in the lyrics of his latest album, his 19th, although Springsteen admits that these days they have lost some of their power as a symbol of freedom and escape.

"At best, they are a metaphor for movement", he says in the film. "When we're in a car we can feel like we're always moving forward. But are we moving forward? A lot of the time, we're just moving."
