**Who is your favourite novelist of all time, and your favourite novelist writing today?**

I like the Russians, the Chekhov short stories, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. I never read any of them until the past four years, and found them to be thoroughly psychologically modern. Personal favourites: The Brothers Karamazov and, of course, Anna Karenina.

Current favourites: Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy and Richard Ford. It's hard to beat American Pastoral, I Married a Communist and Sabbath's Theater. Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian remains a watermark in my reading. It's the combination of Faulkner and Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns that gives the book its spark for me. I love the way Richard Ford writes about New Jersey.

The Sportswriter, Independence Day and The Lay of the Land are all set on my stomping grounds and, besides being poignant and hilarious, nail the Jersey Shore perfectly.

**Who are your favourite musician-writers? Your favourite memoir by a musician?**

I'm not familiar with the musician-novelist but, as far as memoirs, it's hard to beat Keith Richards's love of music that shines through in Life. I also found Eric Clapton's autobiography to be surprisingly revealing and very moving. Of course I loved Bob Dylan's Chronicles. It made me proud to be a musician.

**What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?**

I read a lot on cosmology and a reasonable amount of philosophy. I also like to read about baseball, having just finished Mariano Rivera's autobiography.

For cosmology, Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos by Dennis Overbye was one of my first favourites. I find men and women struggling to answer the deepest questions we can ask freeing. It also puts in scale whatever my small problems of the day might be. The book that turned me on to philosophy was Bertrand Russell's The History of Western Philosophy. I just finished Examined Lives by Jim Miller and How to Live:Or a Life of Montaigne by Sarah Bakewell.

**What's the last book you read that made you laugh?**

Richard Ford's The Lay of the Land.

**The last book that made you cry?**

Cormac McCarthy's The Road.

**The last book that made you furious?**

Too Big to Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin; Michael Lewis's The Big Short; and Someplace Like America by Dale Maharidge, with photographs by Michael S Williamson. These are a few of the books I read on the recent financial collapse and I contributed the foreword to Someplace Like America. The criminal outrage and recklessness described in these books led directly to my Wrecking Ball album.

**What are the best books about music you've read?**

At the top of my list remains Greil Marcus's Mystery Train, followed closely by Peter Guralnick's Last Train to Memphis. I'd include Dylan's Chronicles and a recent book by Daniel Lanois, Soul Mining, that gives insights into the making of music I found unique from any other book out there. Sonata for Jukebox, by Geoffrey O'Brien, has some lovely chapters in it, particularly its opening discussions of Burt Bacharach's career.

**What kind of reader were you as a child?**

The first book I read was The Wizard of Oz one lazy summer on my front porch on Randolph Street in New Jersey. I remember being thrilled by the book and the act of reading. Over time my most beloved character became the great and powerful Oz himself. He's summed up by that great quote that's in the film, but not in the book: "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain." He's a carny phoney, in way over his head, who manages to pull it off anyway. "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain." One of the great quotes in American literature.

**If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?**

One would be difficult, but the short stories of Flannery O'Connor landed hard on me. You could feel within them the unknowability of God, the intangible mysteries of life that confounded her characters and which I find by my side every day. They contained the dark Gothicness of my childhood and yet made me feel fortunate to sit at the centre of this swirling black puzzle, stars reeling overhead, the earth barely beneath us.

You're hosting a literary dinner with three writers. Who's invited?

Philip Roth, Keith Richards, Tolstoy — and one extra, Bob Dylan. A lot of life experience there, and the babbling in different tongues would be wonderful.

**What books do you find yourself returning to again and again?**

I don't read many books twice but Jim Thompson novels — due to their concise, dirty power, their relentless violence and purity — can always draw me in for a second time. Some of the most psychological crime writing ever done. I love James M Cain and Elmore Leonard but Jim Thompson holds a special place in my heart.

**What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?**

I read The Grapes of Wrath very late, long after I'd written the song Ghost of Tom Joad. However, it ended up being everything I'd hoped it to be. I haven't read East of Eden yet, and I'd like to.

**What do you plan to read next?**

I loved The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow, and someone just gave me Henderson the Rain King, so that may be up next.
