His songs speak eloquently about the injustices of blue-collar America. Can Bruce Springsteen do the same in person?

Sanctuary, Bruce Springsteen has found happiness at his New Jersey farm (Jonathan Torgovnik) Bruce Springsteen has got the shed that every man wants.

There's storage space for his motorcycles, for junk and memorabilia. There's a music room with a mixing console and various guitars, and a den with that all- important beer fridge. Recently finished, it still smells of new wood. It's a pretty big shed, but then Springsteen's got a pretty big garden: at least 300 acres of farmland, accessed via a track that takes you through electrically operated gates and past a security hut.

The man who has chronicled the struggles of ordinary people in broken-down, blue-collar towns has settled into the bosom of rural America. Long ago, the land around here earned New Jersey the title of "the Garden State"; hard to imagine as you make the drive from Manhattan, an hour away. Through the tunnel under the Hudson River, on to the New Jersey turnpike, then miles of monotonous industrial landscape. Go far enough south, though, and the factories and fuel depots give way to green fields and fresh air.

New Jersey is very protective. It's out of the media spotlight. I just go where I want to go, and do what I want to do Springsteen's farm is close to Freehold, the Monmouth County town in which he grew up, but it could be in another state or another country. Away from the backstreets and closed-down mills, there's a restored farmhouse and outbuildings surrounded by woodland and pasture. He spends his time here, riding horses and tinkering with his cars, which, since you ask, include a 1960 Chevrolet Corvette, an old '48 Ford Woody and a Range Rover "for getting from A to B". At 61, he's enjoying the rewards of 40 year's rock'n'rolling, which have won him 20 Grammys, an Oscar and undreamt-of wealth. I'm standing in the music room looking at some of the memorabilia, including pictures on the walls of Springsteen with Mick Jagger and Bono, and a cushion embroidered with the cover of Greetings from Asbury Park, his first album.

I don't have long to wait before he breezes in, wiry and weatherbeaten, wearing jeans, work boots and a checked shirt. He's walked across from the main house but he looks as though he could have parked his pick-up truck outside and come in for a beer after a day climbing telegraph poles. Earlier, he was sitting in holiday-weekend traffic, hence the short delay.

"I had to go to the city [New York], which could have been worse, given it was Columbus Day. Then I took a swim in the ocean." Catching my look of surprise, he says. "I go until about November. It's still nice."

He settled in this corner of Monmouth County because people are used to seeing him around and he doesn't get pestered. "New Jersey is very protective. It's out of the general media spotlight you run into in big cities. I still like the ocean, the land around here and the smaller towns. I just go where I want to go, and do what I want to do."

Revitalising this farm has been a long process. He stopped the use of artificial fertiliser that was poisoning the soil — "It took five years to clean the soil, and some expense" — and now grows crops and grazes horses on chemical-free land. He's turned the day-to-day running of it over to an expert in organic farming. Deer and other wildlife migrate here, he says, to escape hunters. Well, well. Springsteen the conservationist. Greetings from the deer park.

We retreat to the den, where there's a big lolling couch and easy chairs. He won't remember, but I've spoken to him once before — at a packed concert in Roundhay Park in Leeds in 1985 when he was on his Born in the USA tour. I was editor of my university magazine and hoping, naively, as I hadn't even approached the tour promoter, to get a few words from him.

As he came off stage I shouted from the crowd, "You didn't play No Surrender."

He shrugged and smiled: "You can't play 'em all." From that, I managed to construct a front-page "exclusive" about my encounter with the Boss.

These days, interviews with Springsteen are, if anything, even harder to get.

When he does them, he generally prefers to do them in a hotel suite in Manhattan, where journalists get a timed slot. One thing Springsteen doesn't need is publicity. He's sold 120m records worldwide, half of them outside the United States.

Four of the five studio albums he's made this decade have gone to No 1 in the US charts. In recession-hit America, his hard-times music about shutdowns and lay-offs is arguably more relevant than ever. If he never wrote or recorded again, he could carry on earning millions from royalties.

But on this occasion there's something on his mind. He's easy-going, affable — disarmingly so. Once we've got a little way through the interview, though, he leans forward and adopts a serious look. "There's a widespread political consciousness that's perhaps deeper in Europe than it is in the States", he says. "I've noticed that, generally, if I'm interviewed by writers from overseas there's a lot of interest [in politics]."

He's saying this in measured tones and there's a message building in his voice. It has to do with America and the way certain things aren't working.

Springsteen nailed his political colours to the mast when he backed Barack Obama in the 2008 election. His song The Rising became a theme of the Democrats' "Vote for Change" rallies and was played over loudspeakers at Obama's victory celebration in Chicago. He seems pleased to be airing his views to a journalist from a country where a state-run health service is not viewed as a throwback to the old Soviet Union.

"The climate [in America] is very, very ugly for getting things done", he says. "The moderate reforms President Obama fought to make are called Marxist, socialist. I mean, the most extreme language is put into play to describe the most modest reforms that would move the economy back towards serving a majority of its citizens. There's a tremendous distortion of information.

"The biggest problem we have now is almost 10% unemployment, but we also have the disparity of wealth. You can't have an American civilisation with the kind of disparity of wealth we have. It will eat away at the country's heart and soul and spirit."

Most people don't want to be taking their political direction from guys that are shaking their ass in front of 60,000 people As Springsteen talks, the targets of his frustration become clearer. Since Obama swept to victory on a wave of popular enthusiasm, the president's ratings have nose-dived and his party took a "shellacking", as he put it in the mid-term elections.

Conservative America — including some sections of the blue-collar bit that happen to be Springsteen's natural constituency — has joined up to obstruct Obama, and Springsteen's angry. "You have a guy [Obama] who comes in, he gets to be president for four years. Maybe eight. But you have the financial institutions, you have the military, the corporations. They're in play constantly and, in truth, they're shaping the economy and shaping the direction the US is moving in. Those forces are huge. The money and lobbyists are pouring in to do everything they can [to preserve the status quo]. It's a very tough time, a very hard time here in the States."

The rich and powerful have made a grab for America, he's telling me, and it's up to ordinary citizens to seize it back. Occasionally, he can sound more like a hardcore politico than the man who paints gritty pictures of the American landscape in his lyrics. "Our economy has oriented itself away from the mass of US citizens and oriented itself to be at the service of the folks at the top, the plutocracy. [It] has to be oriented back to where it serves the health and purposes of a majority of American citizens. That's not on the books right now."

Undoubtedly, he is moved by the worsening plight of those at the bottom of the heap who have been hit hardest by the recession. But isn't this a bit much coming from a man who, according to Forbes magazine, earned £47m ($70m) last year? As well as the farm, there's his house in an ocean-front area of Rumson, New Jersey, across the river from Jon Bon Jovi, plus a retreat in a gated equestrian community in Florida. He paid $3.1m for the Florida house two years ago, then bought a better-appointed neighbouring property for $4.6m, selling the original house at a loss. When he spends time there he's among the well- heeled; his neighbours are Daniel and Ellen Crown, heirs to the General Dynamics fortune.

Does his money make it difficult for him to write credibly about the poor and the dispossessed? He looks at me squarely. "Here's the only thing I know. I write very well about these things. And I think about them very seriously. I take a lot of time and effort in the music that I write to try and honour the experiences of the characters I write about. That's the best a writer can do."

If that sounds like a less-than-satisfactory answer, at least it's an honest one. And it's only fair to point out that in the United States rich people who believe in political reform are not dismissed as champagne socialists, as often happens in Britain. There's no doubt he's sincere, too. This is no longer the Springsteen of the sleeveless T-shirt and bandana, the one who delivered those sinew-straining, fist-in-the air renditions of Born in the USA in the mid-1980s, looking like Robert De Niro from the combat scenes of The Deer Hunter. In those days he steered clear of party politics, fearing — according to his biographer — "his own lack of political expertise would prove embarrassing".

When Reagan used Springsteen's name to rally Republican voters (Reagan misinterpreted Born in the USA as a piece of jingoism instead of what it was — an indictment of the treatment of Vietnam veterans), he delivered a polite put-down to the president. So what changed his mind?

"A moment comes when you cash in whatever credibility a guy can have who plays and sings rock songs for a living and you put your chips where you think they might do some good.

"Most people don't want to be taking their political direction from guys that are shaking their ass in front of 60,000 people. That's understandable. So I put my two cents in when I can, to be as helpful as I can, when the moment arises."

It's a decision he acknowledges has alienated some of his fans. "Half the people you're gonna make mad. And that has to be okay with you. I got some nasty reactions. People sent me busted-up CDs or got mad if they saw me sometimes." Springsteen's very visibility means many fans didn't hesitate to bend his ear. "Like you have the chef in the restaurant run out and say, 'Why are you doing this?' So you find yourself in the parking lot in a 10-minute discussion with the guy who just cooked dinner for you.

"I'm a huge John Wayne fan. I didn't care for his particular political bent, but I still love The Searchers and a lot of other work he's done. Some people may never come and see me again, but I'd hope that's a small percentage."

Springsteen may, in the words of Jeremy Clarkson, have made more money than God, but he made it the American way. In New Jersey in the 1950s and '60s, his parents struggled to support him and his two sisters. His upbringing was marred by frequent rows with his father, who had a string of jobs as bus driver, prison guard and factory worker, but couldn't hold on to any of them.

"There was no going out on Saturday night", Springsteen recalls. "I was never in a restaurant until I had a record contract. I was 27 years old and I'd still be intimidated by the guy on the door at the Steak and Ale. 'You want a table?' 'I don't know. Do I deserve one?' "

At Freehold High School in the 1960s he was "at very best a mediocre student and would probably have been voted least likely to succeed". His enduring memory is of never fitting in. He fared no better when he progressed to Ocean County Community College, where a group of students voted for his expulsion on the grounds of his "unacceptable weirdness".

Summing up his admiration for Bruce, Barack Obama said: 'I'm the president, but he's the Boss"

Weird or not, by his early twenties he was making a name for himself playing gigs on college campuses and in bars along the Jersey Shore.

He earned the "Boss" nickname when he was in charge of doling out the meagre earnings to his band. "It's been the merry bane of my existence ever since", he scolds me when I ask ("and no, my wife does not call me the Boss").

Reconciliation with his father, Douglas, took a little longer. When he won an Oscar for his theme to Philadelphia in 1994, he took the award to show Springsteen Sr. Moved by his son's success, Douglas said, "I'll never tell anybody what to do again", recalls Springsteen.

His father was no longer alive — he died in 1998 — when, last year, Obama handed Bruce one of the highest accolades for those in the performing arts, a Kennedy Center Honor. Summing up his admiration for him, Obama said: "I'm the president, but he's the Boss."

He's leaning back in his chair, smiling at the memory. Lines appear on his face when he casts his mind back to more difficult times.

In the 1970s, Springsteen and the E Street Band spent thousands of hours, mostly unpaid, shaping and recording songs, only to discard most of them. The "outtakes" from this period are what make up a new album, The Promise, which he has spent this summer working on. It consists of songs he decided didn't fit the austere mood of the music he was making at the time.

It's no surprise to hear Springsteen confess on the DVD that accompanies the special-edition version of the album to having an "obsessive compulsive" side to his personality. "I was a dangerous man to be around", he says.

I push a little harder on the demons that drove him. He is famous for never having taken drugs, but it's whispered that he's "done therapy".

"How can I explain it to you?" he says, silent for a moment. "It's simply an investigation of the forces that are at play on your psyche or your behaviour at any given point. I was interested in those forces, both as part of the work I was doing and also because [long pause... laughter] I had a lot of problems.

"I still have 'em but I think there's less now than when I started. Either that or I'm going to want my money back."

The problems that got under his skin, and inside his head, included his marriage in 1985 to the model and actress Julianne Phillips. After a whirlwind romance, the two were forced to conclude they had little in common, she having led, according to friends, a "charmed life", growing up in a well-to-do family on the west coast, him a scruffy rock'n'roller. It was also said that he wanted children; she wasn't ready.

He dissolved the E Street Band in 1989, and moved to LA, starting a family with his new girlfriend, Patti Scialfa, now his wife. His affair with her began when she was a vocalist in the E Street Band, predating an expensive divorce from Phillips.

For a time he recorded with session musicians or on his own, but the shows were never quite the same as with the old line-up. After a decade in the Hollywood Hills, he uprooted and moved his new family back east, setting up home in New Jersey, close to his extended family, and reuniting with the E Street Band. Installed back where he grew up, he was keen to connect with the community. His charitable foundation helped pay for the FoodBank of New Jersey (which distributes food to the hungry) and for repairs for run-down housing in his neighbourhood. Dozens of folk had leaky roofs fixed or heating installed without knowing who their benefactor was.

Previous to family life, I lived upside down and ass backwards, you know. I'd be up all night, sleep all day, do whatever came next He kept an astute eye on his own finances, on one occasion publicly thanking his business team.

"They're the money men", he said at a music-industry event. "They bring back the pink Cadillac, the blue Cadillac, the yellow Cadillac, and the red Cadillac. And they make sure neither you, nor themselves of course, are gonna be broke when you're riding in the black Cadillac."

At the same time, he resisted offers of easy money from advertising and endorsements, turning down on one occasion $12m that Chrysler reportedly offered him to use Born in the USA in a car advert.

"I did?" he says with a twinkle in his eye. "That was the dumbest thing I've ever done. If that's true, can I decide again?"

He later insists it was not about principle. "I don't have to do them [advertisements], you know, so it's a luxury."

After the 9/11 attacks, Springsteen rallied support for a telethon in aid of victims' families. He was moved by the fact that in the obituaries of victims, his music was often mentioned — typically a favourite song or just that they were a fan of the Boss. An album followed, The Rising, recorded in the aftermath of the attacks and released in 2002. There's no denying that Springsteen benefited too. On the subsequent tour, he filled the New York Giants stadium to capacity for a run of 10 concerts — a record.

In 2006, the tabloid New York Post accused him of getting too close to one of the relatives he was trying to help, linking him romantically with the widow of a 9/11 victim. The story petered out, despite being spiced with detail about the woman concerned being a redhead similar to his wife. Allegations of an affair with a different woman emerged in 2009, but were later denied by the alleged mistress. On both occasions, Springsteen dismissed "ugly rumours", saying in a statement that he was a loving father and devoted husband.

In the den, he's hunkered down into an easy chair. He's pausing to let the past catch up with the present. He tells me that his daily routine, when he's not on tour, now revolves around his family. "[Being] a musician is a shiftless lifestyle, one in which you've opted out of conventional rhythms and routines for the most part until family life forces you into them.

"Previous to family life, which was very late for me, in my forties, I lived upside down and ass backwards, you know. I'd be up all night, sleep all day, do whatever came next."

A typical day now starts with the school run. "That's the first thing I do. I make breakfast; I'm sort of in charge of that part of the morning. Once that's successfully accomplished, and quite a challenge it can be, I may work out a bit or sometimes I'll swim in the ocean. In the afternoon I may work on some songs, or whatever I'm doing. Over the years I've learnt to write quite well and quickly in stolen pieces of time. Then there's dinner at home."

Two of Springsteen's children — Evan, 20, and Jessie, 18 — are at university.

Sam, 16, his youngest, is still at school. It's a fee-paying establishment known for rigorous courses and a dress code that would have got Springsteen kicked out in his younger days. His two older children also attended.

Do your kids listen to your music?

"No. Why would they do that? For your kids, it's the least important thing about you. It's just your job and it's actually invasive and intrusive on their lives, I find. They just need you to be Dad. They don't need you to be anything a whole lot more than that. Come in our house, and with the exception of some guitars around, you probably wouldn't know musicians live there."

Many rock musicians might have considered hanging up their Fenders when they hit 60. Instead, Springsteen is taking his music directly to the audience, sidestepping the industry-wide slump in CD sales. His continent-hopping tours, some lasting over a year, have, with U2 and the Stones, put him consistently among the top earners from ticket sales, grossing a reported £276m in the last decade. His biggest followings are in the unlikeliest of places. In Scandinavia, where his music resonates in bleak, snowbound towns, record- company executives talk about the "Bjørn to Run" effect.

In Japan, where rock singers are elevated to deity status, he's known as "Bosu". On the most recent tour, in 2009, he performed in 16 countries at 65 different venues, including Glastonbury, where he was a headline act. So how long can he carry on?

Steve Van Zandt, guitarist, vocalist and Springsteen's most loyal lieutenant, said recently: "Bruce has never talked about stopping. He's not even close to running out of ideas.

"Physically, he's in the greatest shape of his life. There's no reason why we shouldn't keep the band together for another 10 years. Maybe more."

Springsteen hasn't heard the quote before and seems tickled. "Steve said that?

Jesus. Well, I guess it's what I've spent my life doing.

Has he achieved greatness? 'I wanted to be very, very good. I'll leave everyone else to decide how well we did on a scale of 1 to 10"

"That's what gets me up in the morning. Why would you stop?"

He amplifies the point, talking about what makes him continue to "empty the tank" for his audiences night after night, as Jon Stewart, the American TV host, put it recently.

"You have to be able to hold two somewhat conflicting ideas in your mind simultaneously", he says. "One is, it's only rock'n'roll. The other is, at this particular moment, on this particular evening, it's the most important thing in the world you can do. I feel the same as I felt when I was at the Elks Club in Freehold singing Twist and Shout for the first time: abject fear that you've been given an opportunity [and] that you may waste it. I don't want to do that."

I remind him of something he says on the DVD: that when he was 27, his ambition was to be not rich, not happy, not famous, but great.

Has he achieved greatness? He laughs loudly.

"Yes", he says, then checks himself. "I don't know. Perhaps what I meant was that I wanted to be very, very good. I'll leave everyone else to decide how well we did on a scale of 1 to 10."

The interview, sometimes more like a conversation because of his tendency to lapse into the kind of storytelling he does on stage, has been going more than twice the scheduled duration, and it's time to wind up.

He wants to show me a few things on the farm. We go outside, and in the gathering dusk he points out some deer moving like shadows in the grey light.

"We let those out just to show visitors", he jokes. The slightly earthier Springsteen — Springsteen the farmer — takes over. "This place was part of a big area for horses; the red-clay footing was very good on horses' hooves", he says. "It was also a huge agricultural area when I was a child. Originally, the Italians came over and worked in the 1920s, when it was potato farms. Now it's Hispanics. There's still agriculture but it's a lot less. Soil in the area was driven toxic over the years from all the chemicals people fed to crops, so it takes a while to get it back."

We're crunching on a gravel driveway and there's a chill in the autumn evening. Surely there won't be many more ocean swims. Neighbours regard the Springsteen spread as the best horse farm in the area. He keeps quarter horses, a popular American breed that excels at sprinting, as well as a string of showjumpers — "some Olympic standard". His daughter, Jessie, has won a clutch of equestrian awards.

"It's a big place. Patti and I got it just as a respite, you know. She's the one who said, you gotta be responsible for it. She had an eye towards conservation. So all of a sudden, you're the caretaker."

He's smiling as we part company. Before I leave, I tell him about an office cleaner who used to live in my road. Displayed proudly on the side of his van was his firm's name: Spruce Springclean.

Back then, this man would stop me whenever I walked past and remind me that "Elvis may be the King but Springsteen is the Boss." That was 20 years ago.

Spruce Springclean. And yes, he's still chuckling as he heads back to the shed.
