ALL DRESSED UP AND NO PLACE TO GO

"When his two-hour set ended I could only think, can anyone really be this good: can anyone say this much to me, can rock 'n' roll still speak with this kind of power and glory?"

These questions, which he then went on to answer, were posed by Jon Landau in a May issue of Rolling Stone. His five hundred word eulogy provided a head and shoulders vignette of a New Jersey street poet called Bruce Springsteen. "I racked my brains but simply can't think of a white artist who does so many thinks so superbly", went on Landau, stretching out in uncustomary fashion. "There is no-one I would rather watch onstage today... " Jeeez.

Announcing the second coming of the man who first appeared from the pens of the scribes as the brother Messiah of Bob Dylan. One way and another American critics have laid a heavy onus on Springsteen but I guess it's easier to live up to a placing in just about every US writer's 1974 Playlist than to efface the charlatan connotations which accolades pertaining to Dylan invariably conjour up in the eyes of the beholder.

It just so happens that I agree with all Mr. Landau's comments and I'm glad that he, too, can detect the power of Springsteen's band ringing in his tired old bones just as I'm glad that Mr. Springsteen can quote dismissively that "Dylan influenced me as much as anyone I guess... when I was fourteen maybe... but I don't think about the comparison too much."

A couple of years after it started, CBS's attitude in building Springsteen into the star the critics say he already is remains bewildering. He's never been to England and currently waits for his new single to be completed with the desperation of a man who's flat broke, pinning his final hopes on the record, wondering whether his band will survive and seeking fit to qualify only that he doesn't feel he's written AM station lyrics. When did he ever?

I've travelled 18,000 miles to see Springsteen twice, courtesy of CBS London and shared my enthusiasm with other foreign journalists as the Springsteen band have disseminated waves of ectasy across theatre auditoriums and yet he maintains that Columbia have been constantly cool in dealing with their wonder talent.

Peter Jay Philbin , a friend of Springsteen's long before joining CBS International press department in New York, claims that it isn't until sales really start to look good that CBS throw the full weight of the heavy artillery into the game and right now Springsteen may be the critics' fave but he ain't selling albums. All dressed up and no place to go.

"We're at the lowest we've ever been right now", he told me last month. "It means that if we don't play every week of the year then we don't have money. Right now we've just come off the road and the guys are getting thrown out of their houses. Hopefully I'll be getting some money from Columbia and maybe with David Bowie doing some of the songs that'll be good. But that's the only problem right now... it's sort of a shame... I'd just like to be a little more secure that's all", he said in a vain attempt to make light of the problem.

Physically, Bruce Springsteen has all the hallmarks of a guy who's spent his life being dragged through the gutter. He's of frail build, sports a scrubby beard and matted, tousled hair, has a uneven gait (stumbles) uneven speech (mumbles). Shirt tails hang beneath an old leather jacket that's followed him around 1,000 gigs and religiously been thrown from his shoulders at some point during the 120 minutes' worth of music that his band are guaranteed to pound out whether the contract says so or not.

Such was the case at Georgetown University, Washington in March 1974 – a Jesuit college who's only claim to fame is the centrepiece of Blatty's Exorcist. My second visit to the Springsteen show.

The first show opens, and to my delight it belongs to John Hall's band Orleans. Springsteen does his coupla hours. They take a break. Orleans open the second show and the audience bitch for an encore. Springsteen wanders onstage... the city orphan who had just cancelled two gigs because he'd been throwing up blood. Homes in on his regular showstoppers, and with all that out of the way, starts pulling up these old r&b classics like 'Walking The Dog' and 'Let The be Four Winds Blow' with total disdain of the fact that we're living in the seventies. The show takes on a strange atmosphere that only nocturnal energy can generate and when this spirit in the night staggers off stage, beads of sweat dripping from the huge black frame of number one sideman Clarence Clemmons, it's way past three. In the dressing room a grand piano awaits his call and he starts to re-work a theme that he's been trying to mould into a song.

"MANY FALSE IMPRESSIONS WERE DRAWN" He has this knack of being able to make himself totally unobtrusive, quietly waiting for the band to wander out into the approaching dawn before settling down to an interview with more commitment than you'd dare expect at 4.30 am.

Springsteen emerged out of rhythm and blues and rock and roll and the whole legacy of Chuck Berry and people like Gary U.S. Bonds. "All those old r&b type people – Bonds had a great feeling on all his records, a feeling that everyone was singing, you know, thirty guys all playing and singing in the studio at the same time on things like 'Quarter To Three' and 'School Is Out'.

It explains his obsession for a loose back-up band with a honking sax, and the same confusion, the same party chaos that he carries through so well in 'E Street Shuffle' and more especially, 'Rosalita'. As a bar musician he had little use for lyrics that delved beyond the accepted demarcation lines of rhythm 'n' blues sentiment. "I used to write straight rock stuff because the situation was such that whether we were playing in a bar or in a club the general conditions and PA were so bad you had to communicate on the most basic level you could and I was just never in a position to do more.

"But after that, the ten-piece band went down to seven-piece and then five- piece and then just me, so that's when I really started to write some different types of lyric. The thing is I'd been fronting a band for nine years but when I walked to the record companies there was just me by myself with a guitar, and from that many false impressions were drawn."

It's an important point and this fact, plus Columbia's dilatory behaviour in getting Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. onto their schedules that resulted in Springsteen's debut being about half as auspicious as it might have been. "The album was so old by the time it got released, and I write songs fast, so that I was doing all kinds of different material by the time it got released.

"I mean, I like to be doing new material but that record reflects the mood I was in at that particular time... you know, the fact of having to come into the city from where I was living, and I didn't have a band so it all contributed to that kind of down feel. But towards the end of the record I started pulling out of it with songs like 'Spirit In The Night' which started to get into a whole different feel."

Asbury Park was recorded at 914 Sound Studios, Blauvelt, New York, co-produced by Mike Appel (Springsteen's manager) and Jim Cretecos featuring the collective talents of Vini Lopez, Clarence Clemmons, Gary Tallent, David Sancious, Harold Wheeler and Richard Davis of which the first four became regular members of the band and all but Lopez remain. That's the bare facts. The album, fronted by a picture postcard of Asbury Park, painted a sombre picture of city life and its victims – characters portrayed in the shadow of death. The production and some of the playing often leave room for improvement but it is impossible to deny the power and feeling which Springsteen's words and song structures exude just as it's impossible to deny the presence and strength of his imagery even when it threatens to dictate or obscure a song rather than carry it along.

Of such paranoia Springsteen chooses to remain on the periphery and merely record it journalistically. "I can rise to an occasion... like with that album. The rest of the time I'm kind of laid back because there's too much going on to get excited about, too many people running around crazy. I just prefer to let it go."

In New Jersey he prefers the incongruous... like water sports. He left the board walk life portrayed so vividly by Jack Nicholson in The King Of Marvin Gardens and misses the rundown environment of his adolescent period, living over a drugstore or whatever it was. The road is no place to write your new album, back in Asbury Park things were different.

"I see these situations happening when I sing them and I know the characters well. I use them in different songs and see them in shadows – they're probably based on people I know or else they're flashes, that just appear there. There's a lot of activity, a whole mess of people... it's like if you're walking down the street, my songs are what you see, only distorted. A lot of songs were written without any music at all, it's just that I do like to sing the words."

Springsteen's picture-book of city street life is a nightmare vision. "My songs are supposed to be bigger than life", he claims, but he insists he has not been blessed with any greater powers of insight than the next person.

"Jersey was so intense you couldn't even walk down the street so I used to go to New York and hang out in the Village mostly, but also uptown a little bit.

GREENWICH VILLAGE FOLK URCHIN "I was mostly by myself with no particular place to go, but sometimes I'd hang out with this other guy."

So paradoxically when Springsteen made it with Columbia it was as a Greenwich Village folk urchin. Totally out of context. "I'd written my first batch of songs and if nothing had come of it I'd probably have been back in the bars by now", he quipped at the time.

CBS went with 'Blinded By The Light' for the single, Springsteen twisting as much distorted lyric into the metre as possible and hanging a catchy chorus at the end of each verse. A good ensemble legacy from his rock 'n' roll days.

Yeah he was blinded by the light. Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night. Blinded by the light, He got down but the never got tight But he's gonna make it tonight... .

The best songs on that album, says Bruce were those written over a short period of time. Like the incredible suicide ballad 'For You' which remains one of Springsteen's greatest achievements as he recounts the final minutes of life drawing back to the final chorus with its emotive cry.

I came for you, for you, I came for you, But you did not need my urgency. I came for you, for you, I came for you, But your life was one long emergency. And your cloud line urges me And my electric surges free.

'The Angel', says Springsteen, is one of his great favourites – conceived, constructed and completed inside fifteen minutes. "It's the most sophisticated thing I've done", he said referring to the sex-power-death trip of the Angel astride his chopper. He starts the song thus :

The angel rides with hunchbacked children, Poison oozing from his engine, Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, On his way to hubcap heaven...

and concludes:

Off in the distance the marble dome Reflects across the flatlands with a naked feel off into parts unknown , The Woman strokes his polished chrome And lies beside the angel's bones... .

He hipped up the same theme in his trilogy of death in 'Lost In The Flood' where he portrays death as a sort of macabre disappearing point.

He rides her low on the hip, on the side he's got 'Bound For Glory' in red white and blue flash paint, He leans on the hood telling racing stories, The kids call him Jimmy the Saint. Well that blaze and noise boy, He's gunning that bitch to blasting point He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point And there's nothin' left where the body fell. And there's nothin' left that you could sell, Just junk all across the horizon, A real highwayman's farewell... .

More recently David Bowie pulled 'Growin' Up' and 'It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City' from the same album to record; one a pop song, the other perhaps a little too ambitious and expansive, but both pre-ordained for Bowie; in any event by the time Springsteen was set to record his second album, The Wild, The Innocent And The 'E' Street Shuffle, he'd ironed out all his problems. Same studio, same producers but this time a band who had been knocked into shape on the road, largely through the experience of veteran horn player Clarence Clemmons, who once worked with James Brown.

"The mistake", Springsteen reflected, "is in thinking that you are those songs", in an obvious allusion to the self-destructive influence the presence of his ego in those songs was having. "To me a song is a vision, a flash, and what I see is characters in situations.

"I mean I've stood around carnivals at nights when they're clearing up and I was scared ['Wild Billy's Circus Story', still one of the highlights of the show with Garry Tallent playing tuba and Danny Federici accordion. Just that.] As for Spanish Johnny's situation ['Incident On 57th Street'], well I'd never get into that kind of situation but I know people who have lived that life."

You have to remember that it ain't easy to commute between Asbury Park and the Cafe Wha? down in the Village and hang onto your sanity. And it takes a lot of guts to blow your record advance on putting together a band – a band that Bruce calls "a really spacey bunch of guys...but a pretty regular band". There's been only one personnel change in two years, Ernest Boon Carter having replaced Vini Lopez on drums.

"Vini'd been around for years", Bruce qualified vaguely. "There'd been various pressures... it was a difficult decision to make."

In truth, Asbury Park had a lot to do with the feel of the first album. "Jersey's a dumpy joint", Springsteen had said. I mean it's OK, it's home, but every place is a dump."

"EVERY SYLLABLE ADDS SOMETHING TO HIS ULTIMATE GOAL" "Springsteen does it all. He's a rock 'n' roll punk, a Latin street poet, a ballet dancer, an actor, a poet joker, a bar band leader, hot-shit rhythm guitar player, extraordinary singer and a truly great rock 'n' roll composer. He leads a band like he's been doing it forever... Bruce Springsteen is a wonder to look at: skinny, dressed like a reject from Sha Na Na, he parades in front of his all star rhythm band like a cross between Chuck Berry, early Bob Dylan and Marlon Brando. Every gesture, every sylable adds something to his ultimate goal – to liberate our spirit while he liberates his by baring his soul through his music." Another sizeable chunk from Jon Laundau's Rolling Stone review that pretty much sums up the impact of a Springsteen show. But having looked at the lyrics, some qualifications of the musicians in the band.

Bruce looks like he's appeared out of thin air but he's a regular old timer and he was just a straight forward rhythm guitarist in a band before coming out as a front man. He led a ten-piece in the bars and rough houses of New Jersey, and it was an experience that ultimately brought him down. But in the last and best bar band he had built up quite a following in the Southern States. "Over about four years I played mostly down South – for some reason I got popular around Virginia, Tennessee and Carolina and I played in a lotta different towns with the ten-piece band."

His band today may lack the sophistication of Van Morrison or Tim Buckley but the versatility is indisputable. A long time admirer of Bruce's, watching the Georgetown gig and taking note of the amorphous nature of his songs, was moved to comment that he'd never heard Springsteen play or sing a song the same way twice. 'New York City Serenade' has changed beyond belief whilst 'Kitty's Back' (one of the best kinetic compositions) was stretched across a super-long embellished piano solo from David Sancious. "There was more of the band in the second album and the songs were written more in the way I wanted to write but I change the arrangements all the time in order to present the material best and to suit the style of the band. I just try to update the arrangements a bit to keep everyone interested. 'Sandy', for instance, I like the way it is on the record but it was entirely different right up until the night I recorded it and then I changed it."

For this next album Bruce plans to incorporate chick singers and horns. He would do the same onstage but for the economics of it all.

The road has really taken its toll on Springsteen's health. When I'd seen him in Washington he'd been bemoaning the lack of good food and swigging cough mixture from a bottle. Some months later, talking to him on the phone to New Jersey he could find little cause for optimism. The Wild, The Innocent And the E Street Shuffle, far more of an energy, band participation album, he said, had generally been better received and sold in larger quantities than the first album although Peter Philbin reckons the composition already shows signs of him being sucked away from his native enviroment. Technically it's a far better album, the tracks are longer and go through more mood changes and yet it doesn't reveal the same highs that the first had, though on reflection I think it would have been impossible to paint as vivid a picture that Springsteen had managed first time around. In the light of this, the lyrics on the second album lack the same monolithic grace as the first; no further qualification necessary – just cop a listen to the finished product.

"I'm still fooling with the words for the new single but I think it'll be good", said Springsteen, taking up the story once again. "I've written a lot of stuff for the new album but when I get into the studio I'll have a clear picture – but it's a different assortment of material and most of it relates pretty much not to touring or playing in a band because we haven't played much at all this summer – but lately I've been getting a rush to write new songs and I've got quite a few, some short and some long."

Mike Appel will again be producing. "I haven't met anyone else who understands the situation any better and he's very involved; besides I don't like too many outside people involved, it just gets too impersonal, that's why I never pick session musicians."

He believes his band are improving and tightening all the time but as to whether his next album will outsell the previous two he's reluctant to say. "I do sell records... but real slow and not many... about 500 or 1,000 each week. I don't think too many people listen to reviews and articles with regard to spending the bucks."

He is particularly anxious to tour his current band in Britain before the line-up changes – and changes are very much on the cards. "It's a very open situation right now. I'm definitely going to add people, possibly a horn section and people who can double on instruments like a violin and trumpet maybe."

-

"RENTS ARE DUE AND ALIMONY AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY" At last Bruce Springsteen realises he is on the verge of a breakthrough and by constant touring he has managed to "erase false images that people have".

But on a serious note he underlines his financial problem. "I'd like to get out of this situation where I haven't paid the band for three weeks. Rents are due and alimony and we just don't have the money. At this stage of the game it's really a shame and I'd just like to get some income because in the last two years we've just managed to make ends meet and sometimes we don't; so we're at the lowest we've ever been right now and if we don't play every week we don't have money... it's as easy as that."

But he clearly visualises the theme of his third album in the light of the first and second. "Those were two very different albums", he appraised. "The second is more popular and it's sold more – I guess it's more musical, but the first one has a certain something for me. I tended to do two totally different things – the first album was a very radical album whereas the second wasn't quite so much. I'm surprised it didn't do better than it did because it sounded very commercial to me. This new album will possibly be something of a balance between the two – I'll try and hit somewhere between."

There we have it then. Bruce Springsteen, the city punk with a disparate bunch of bar boys he calls his band. Just a bunch of lost souls striving to recover and release theirs through the music, or as a Jimmy Spheeris once likened his own urban paranoia to a "surfer boy stranded with city sand in my shoes".

But for all it shambolic appearance, weird stage drawl that makes him relatively unintelligible, Bruce Springsteen has used the legacy of the fifties more comprehensively than anyone, from his rough, tough R&B approach to the vivid documentation of his experiences. Maybe he is Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac and James Dean all rolled into one, but if that's true then there's also a lotta James Brown and Gary Bonds tucked in there too.
