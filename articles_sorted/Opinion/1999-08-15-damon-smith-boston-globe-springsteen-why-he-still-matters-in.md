I never liked Bruce Springsteen very much. In fact, it's safe to say I hated him. And I had plenty of reasons.

Back in 1984, when I was in high school, I wasn't familiar with Springsteen's music as much as I was with the phenomenon of his enormous popularity and the hype surrounding the release of "Born in the U.S.A.", an album that I associated with fist-pumping jocks and bad MTV videos. The level of attention paid to his album, his life and career, the day-to-day details of his every move -- the sheer fact of his omnipresence -- could not have been surpassed if he'd been the Second Coming. Everyone seemed to adore this scruffy guy with the buff frame in cuffed shirts and blue jeans who suddenly loomed larger than life. Indeed, Springsteen mania took hold that year in a way that utterly mystified me, especially since my young rebellious mind grew an instant distaste for anything that courted mass appeal or sought to engender national pride.

I had heard "Born to Run" and "Tenth Avenue Freezeout" blaring from car stereos when I was just a tyke, but it wasn't until my friend Jim bought "Born in the U.S.A." and made me listen to it hundreds of times as he drove us to school that a clearer picture of Springsteen emerged. One day, sick to death of listening to the Boss, I pulled the lyric sheet out of Jim's cassette case so I could criticize the patriotic sentiment of the song "Born in the U.S.A."

But instead of finding a rosy portrait of small-town life or a paean to American might, as I expected, I read about a man "born down in a dead man's town" who compared himself to a cowering dog "that's been beat too much." If I was surprised at the opening lines, the next verse was like a hard slap in the face: "Got in a little hometown jam / So they put a rifle in my hand / Sent me off to a foreign land / To go and kill the yellow man."

This was no glorified American success story. Springsteen had assumed the voice of a loser and an underdog, a guy down on his luck from the very start; the line "born in the U.S.A." was a powerful lament, or at least loaded with ambiguous meaning. I identified with that. Neither Jim nor any of my peers seemed to understand the irony of interpreting the chorus as a triumphant cheer rather than a bitter statement of fact. Neither did Ronald Reagan's campaign manager, apparently, who wanted to use the song for political- cheerleading purposes (Springsteen refused). I realized something important about Springsteen then, something I never forgot. Bruce Springsteen was more complex than many of his fans wanted him to be, or perhaps allowed him to be -- at least the ones who embraced him as a fellow conservative, or a proud American belting out his self-penned anthem with rugged delight.

He earned my respect, but that still didn't steer me past the bombastic Phil Spector-ish sound of his records, largely because my taste, like that of so many of my teenage friends during the Reagan years, steered toward hard-core punk rock -- the fast, furious, and anti-authoritarian. The bands I liked dealt primarily with themes of suburban alienation and the emptiness of everyday life with all the musical subtlety of a chainsaw. Springsteen took up those themes too, but as a storyteller, not an acid commentator, and the straightforward, blues-based rock 'n' roll he made with the E Street Band was not for me. Now that I'm a bit older and spend a lot more time thinking about music, about the mechanics of songs and the nature of good songwriting, I have a much deeper appreciation of Springsteen's musicianship and a better sense of his importance as a cultural figure.

I still listen to my beat-up punk records with a nostalgic thrill, probably the same way Springsteen fans of an earlier generation still get into hearing "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." or "Born to Run" and romanticize their adolescence or young adulthood. Not long ago, when I turned 30, I started thinking about and exploring my own roots, which are in the Southwest, and that led me to refamiliarize myself with the country music of previous decades, and to develop a deep love for a tradition that shaped me more than I knew. Eventually I began playing music that drew from those sources, as well as early rock 'n' roll. Part of that education brought me around to Springsteen again.

I never owned a Bruce Springsteen record until last year, when a friend of mine urged me to find a copy of "Nebraska" and spend an evening listening to its spare melodies of desperation, lives gone wrong, and late-night drives on the New Jersey Turnpike. I've since worn the grooves out on that record. I part ways with those who think Springsteen sounds best with a band. To my admittedly lo-fi-loving ears, "Nebraska" is the finest album he's ever made.

With an acoustic guitar, a harmonica, and a four-track tape recorder, Springsteen managed to distill a potent record that captured everything great about his past work with the E Street Band, like "Streets of Fire", "Born to Run", and "Backstreets." But stripped down to these rudimentary essentials, the sound of the record is darker, more primal than anything else he recorded.

It resonates with me because the songs are stark, edgy, mournful tales told in simple language, like those of Hank Williams. The out-of- focus black-and- white photo of him standing in a doorway on the inside cover is haunting, the antithesis of a rock star, and worlds apart from the smiling do-gooder I remembered from the "Dancing in the Dark" video.

What appeals to me most about Springsteen, particularly with "Nebraska", is that his themes go to the heart of life itself as it's lived by ordinary people -- not "now" or "back then", necessarily, but here in America -- the way a lot of old country or blues artists did. He endures and reaches younger listeners, I think, partly because of the reputation of his concert performances and the quasi- legendary status an older generation has bequeathed him, and partly because his most canonized songs -- before "Born in the U.S.A." -- still sound damn good on a car radio. I would guess, too, that a lot of younger fans go to his arena shows the way they would a football game, because it's an event, and never listen to his records at all. But I also imagine that many of them, like me, cruised the streets in a nowhere place looking for something to do, and could hear an album like "Nebraska" and marvel at Springsteen's songwriting as much as his showmanship. Of course, bands like Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson capture the contemporary mood by giving the anomie of youth a mainstream sound, but their songs don't carry the same literary weight.

Springsteen is the only mainstream artist I can think of who writes convincingly about the working class, and about the average guy's experience of life in the suburbs, or anyplace else, for that matter. He sympathizes with the hardhats, the union grunts who perform thankless jobs in the oil refineries or on the factory line and who experience the spiritual crush of the working life. Coming of age in Texas, I worked on cars in a transmission shop, slung hash in a restaurant, toiled in an auto-parts warehouse, and unloaded freight trucks on the evening shift to pay for my escape from that drudgery. I bought an education, instead of a car, with the money I saved -- but a lot of my friends didn't have that opportunity. Some of them, frustrated, anxious, and bored, got into trouble with the law, and these are situations Springsteen seems to understand as well.

He writes of average guys with shattered hopes who've pursued the runaway American dream and come up empty-handed, who are burning with the desire for something better, a life outside the back streets and the badlands, the chance to reach a promised land that exists apart from the darkness at the edge of town. This is the central nervous system of his musical sensibility. And even though he is partial to portraying such lives, to offering vignettes of hard lives and moribund existence, he infuses these suburban tales with a subtle sense of hope or dignity, something that keeps the danger of pure nihilism at bay.

If you're going to the FleetCenter to see Springsteen and the E Street Band play together live for the first time in a decade, you can be sure you'll be treated to a marathon two- to three-hour concert, and a rousing performance by a great American artist. As for me, you might find me at home, letting the needle on my turntable burn through a few more grooves of "Nebraska", like a car creepin' through the nighttime on a long, deserted highway leading out of town.
