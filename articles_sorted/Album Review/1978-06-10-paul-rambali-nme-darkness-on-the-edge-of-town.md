So where you been, Bruce?

POOR OLD Bruce Springsteen. Through no particular fault of his own, he finds he has more to live down than most musicians ever have to live up to. That doesn't mean he hasn't got an awful lot to live up to as well; it merely emphasises his prickly position.

Springsteen, you may remember, is no stranger to the bloated claims of shortsighted critics and short-term loan publicity machines. After a good, if somewhat patchy and sometimes indulgent first album and then a steadily maturing second effort, he was unlucky enough to be proclaimed the New Bob Dylan, class of '73. John Prine held the title in '72, and Elliot Murphy won it in '74 – everybody ignored them too.

Then, in the winter of '75, came Born To Run. The New Jersey Devil's backstreet romance scenario was given full reign. Then, after the hype, came the backlash. It manifested itself in an almost universal and to my mind undeserved thumbs down for his debut British gigs. It became cool to be unmoved by Born To Run – to actively hate it would have given the game away.

All of which served to obscure the true nature of things. Born To Run was a good album – certainly fresher and more exciting than much of what was around at the time – but not without its faults. The fanciful imagery was prone to excess (like spreading half a jar of peanut butter on a slice of bread) and the canyon-like production didn't help (adding half a jar of jam too).

Since then Springsteen has had lengthy legal squabbles freeing himself from his former managers, instinctively dodged any press encounters, taken to performing mostly old R&B songs for fear of bootleggers getting hold of his new material, written songs for Southside Johnny, Patti Smith and Robert Gordon, and recorded a new album over a period of nine months. Promotion this time is distinctly low profile. The budget has been limited by his order, and no words of hyperbole adorn the ads – just 'Bruce Springsteen, his new album'.

And in the mighty opening rush of 'Badlands' you feel – if nothing else – it's good to have him back. The first South side cadence; the cavernous guitar sound; Clarence Clemons' rasping sax solo; the chord changes: it's a rousing textbook Springsteen anthem – as is its counterpart on the second side, 'The Promised Land'. Four lines in and he squares up to the events that have overtaken him since the release of Born To Run: "I'm caught in a crossfire that I don't even understand".

The adrenalin level intensifies for 'Adam Raised A Cain', a brooding slow burner that in tandem with side two's 'Factory' reveals an enigmatic twist in his lyrical preoccupations. Both songs are about his father, whom he romanticizes as someone whose hopes were crushed by the system, and whose life coloured the fears and aspirations of his son; "You inherit the sins, you inherit the flames".

In fact, the sombre sad evocation of the working life in 'Factory' and 'Cain's' baptism of hellfire emerge as the killer standouts.

And then there's 'Candy's Room', a song about being in love with a whore where Springsteen – as with the above pair – momentarily exceeds his musical and vocal confines, in this case with an intoxicating circular hook and some Bowie-like intonation.

'Something In The Night', 'Racing In The Streets', 'Streets Of Fire' and 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town' are standard widescreen vehicles where he narrowly escapes self-parody. The songs themselves, though strangely subdued and sometimes even Jackson Browne dirge-like, are all-too-classic Springsteen from subject matter right down to 'Be My Baby' backbeat.

That leaves only 'Prove It All Night'. It's the direct choice for a single and confirms lurking suspicions that 'Because The Night' had a lot more to do with Bruce Springsteen than Ms Patti Lee Smith.

So, Darkness On The Edge Of Town walks a fine line between the outrageous claims made on Springsteen's behalf and his tendency towards a grandiose, epic feel that encouraged those claims in the first place. The blockbluster production techniques of Born To Run have been studiously avoided, and the conquer-the-world romantic of before sounds oddly disillusioned, frustrated even.
