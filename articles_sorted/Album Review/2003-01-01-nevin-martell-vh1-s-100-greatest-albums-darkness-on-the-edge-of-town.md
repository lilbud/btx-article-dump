For anyone who might have thought Bruce Springsteen couldn't sustain the creative arc and evolutionary path attained on his breakthrough album, Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town proved them soundly wrong. With this astounding album, the New Jersey native took his bar-band boogie from the boardwalk to sold-out shows across the States and let everyone know that he would forever be "The Boss."

With a title that hints at the invisible corners in life that some can't see into and others choose not to see at all, Darkness's lyrics represent a streetwise poeticism that is lofty without being highbrow and straightforward without being simplistic. From the badlands to the Promised Land with the wastelands and the heartland in between, Springsteen travels across the American dream as his cast of outsiders, dreamers, and quiet failures yearn for redemption, wisdom, and escape. On "Prove It All Night" he sings "Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist / There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this", epitomizing that basic sense of hope that his songwriting of this period captured so eloquently. You got the sense when you listened to Springsteen that he wanted the same things as his tortured characteres. So, when he sang "For all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels rumbling through this promised land / Tonight my baby and me, we're gonna ride to the sea" in "Racing in the Street", you knew that he too was gonna drive to the sea if it was the last thing he did. And you loved him for it.

Kicking up a notch the wall-of-sound aesthetic he had so successfully employed on his previous LP, Darkness on the Edge of Town takes out all the exuberance and joy from the mix and leaves the listener to contemplate the music's somber underbelly. This set of material ranks as one of the great examples American songwriting and helped place Bruce Springsteen in the pantheon alongside the likes of Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. And that is where he remains decades later, still standing as one of the most vital and influential rock 'n' roll artists of all time.

Darkness on the Edge of Town was voted the 68th greatest album of all time in a VH1 poll of over 700 musicians, songwriters, disc jockeys, radio programmers, and critics in 2003.
