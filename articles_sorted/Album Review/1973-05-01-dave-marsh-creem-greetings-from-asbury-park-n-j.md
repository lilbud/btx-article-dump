BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN has enough gall to actually commit suicide on stage of his own volition. Unlike Alice Cooper and David Bowie, who only yak about such stunts, Bruce would obviously come through all the way if given the opportunity. Unfortunately, his record company is trying to steal the scene by the usual act of ritual infanticide: i.e., claiming that Bruce is the Baby Bobby Dylan.

Well, bull-shit, because Bruce Springsteen is really a throw-back all the way to the '50s. Springsteen is like Bo Diddley, like Elvis, like Jerry Lee. His entire career is based upon a total disregard for taste and control on the most fundamental level. "Ain't I a swell guy because I don't smoke dope, I drink beer" is out the window, – Bruce is so cool he probably does still smoke dope, he probably even shoots a little speed now and then to keep it going.

Also, since Asbury Park, New Jersey is obviously one of the half dozen scuzziest places in the Western Hemisphere, Springsteen is the obvious heir- apparent to the throne of Scuzz King of Rock 'n' Roll, as soon as we stop being bamboozled by the klutz konsciousness inherent in our devotion to such pseudo-seamy vice-lords of pop as A.C., D.B., Lou Reed, and other nubile wankers-off in the face of Total Trash Thrills.

Springsteen is possibly the only man in America who could out talk a rock critic, even if he spotted the rock critic a hit of speed, and he could do it because he doesn't give a shit how big a fool he makes of himself, he don't spend his time making up all kinds of fancy-ass phrases, he couldn't pronounce Roget if you stuck a .38 in his mouth and threatened to pull the trigger.

Which also don't mean he's any kind of John Prine "I grew up in white slums and baby it's cold outside" corpse. If Elvis is the Pope of Pop with the ultimate secular call-and-response gospel show at his fingertips, Bruce Springsteen is like a Gnostic who spent three and a half years just slightly A.D. sitting on a rock in the middle of the desert, without eating so much as a breadcrust and came down jibjabbering, having not only seen the Lord but become him, if only for a Warholian quarter-hour. He spews it on out.

St. Paul pulled the plug on them cats, but Bruce Springsteen don't need to have Columbia do that to him. There's one crucial difference between him and Dylan, see. Bruce Springsteen's no has-been.
