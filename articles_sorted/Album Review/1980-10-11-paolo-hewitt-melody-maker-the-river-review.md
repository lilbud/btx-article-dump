LISTENING to Bruce Springsteen's The River is like taking a trip through the rock 'n' roll heartland as you've never experienced it. It's a walk down all the streets, all the places, all the people and all the souls that rock has ever visited, excited, cried for and loved.

The River is an unashamed celebration of rock music, all of it's 25 years, and only Bruce Springsteen could have pulled it off with so much drama, panache and excitement.

Two years ago with Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Springsteen kicked out with a vengeance most of his early romantic scenarios and characters, and looked with a cracking heart at man's lost soul and vitality; a vision exemplified best by the title track, a despairing, frightening scream for lost souls.

With this, his fifth album in eight years, Springsteen's taken the hurt of Darkness, and the glory of Born To Run, and welded it into an exhilarating blend of rock that nods at all its sources, and then dances out of the speakers in blue jeans and smiles, sorrow and compassion in it's hands.

It's the full realisation of Springsteen's talent; and on the fourth track into the album, 'Two Hearts', Springsteen gives full notice of his new found style.

"Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes", he hurls over a full blooded backing. "But I was living in a world of childish dreams. Someday these childish dreams must end/To become a man/and grow up to dream again/Now I believe in the end."

Forever a romantic, some songs on this album betray Springsteen's indulgent muse – 'Ramrod', for instance; but at least he can acknowledge this weakness.

It's also interesting to note that the songs with the most hurt and relevance were mainly written in 1979, while all the joyfully indulgent rockers came this year, maybe to counterbalance the cathartic emotions that Darkness had displayed.

With the first track, Springsteen establishes the album's mood perfectly. A roll of drums, that classic rush of Springsteen sound the E-Street Band are so expert in creating, enhanced by the incredibly large, Spectorish production, and then Springsteen's despairing, yet warm vocals, warning us about the 'Ties That Bind'.

"You're so afraid of being somebody's fool/Not walking tough baby, not walking cool/You walk cool but darlin' can you walk the line...and face the ties that bind".

And later on...'I would rather feel the hurt inside, yes I would darlin'/Than know the emptiness your heart must hide".

In other people's hands that would've been a condemnation. In Bruce's, it's pure compassion.

'Sherry Darling' the next track up, is just classic rock 'n' roll: a swinging, dancing song punctuated by some great saxophone work courtesy of Clarence Clemons, and a good live feel, with Springsteen displaying a sense of humour.

It's about his girlfriend's mother "yapping" in the back seat of his car.

"Now Sherry my love for you is real", Bruce shouts. "But I didn't count on this package deal!"

The next song, 'Jackson's Cage', is used as an effective metaphor for trapped people, forced to lose respect and dignity. As with most of the album the music is totally 'up', but the lyrics are emotional enough to make you cry.

It's the last song on this opening side that breaks all the barriers and puts Bruce Sprinsteen into the league of greats. 'Independence Day' is going to mean a lot of things to a lot of people. The song concerns itself with the inevitable break of child from parent and is set to some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.

A haunting keyboard melody is picked up by a firm acoustic guitar, and then Springsteen's evocative vocals enter, addressing his father: "Well Papa go to bed now...it's getting late/Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now...there's a darkness in this town that's got us too/But they can't touch me now/And you can't touch me now/They ain't gonna do to me/What I watched them do to you."

It perfectly sums up what Bruce Springsteen and his work is about: A respect for tradition as shown in his rock 'n' roll roots and music, but still that undeniable search for freedom and soul.

It's one of the finest songs he's written, and demon's sax break is inspired.

Over on side two, it's party time. 'Hungry Heart', with its drums so clean and loud, makes you notice the wide expansive production that allows each song to literally shake you by the heart and throat.

'Out In The Street' is exactly that: a street song of work and youthful assertion. 'Crush On You' is pure dance music boosted by an infectious riff, some incredible slide guitar from Miami Steve Van Zandt, Springsteen's guitar sidekick. 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)' again displays humour as Springsteen takes Dirty Annie to a lover's rendezvous, sets the music low and then hears "a tapping on the window and a voice in the dark", saying...'You can look but you better not..."

'I Wanna Marry You' slows the pace right down: it's a beautiful, touching song full of romance and concern, the only hitch being the touch of conservatism he brings in when talking about responsibilities and having a "home and family", as though he's Ronald Reagan's speechwriter.

The title track finishes off the first album and again is classic Springsteen, though the actual music is reminiscent of Neil Young, with it's dark, potent, acoustic guitar offset by a bitter-sweet harmonica. Again it deals with the destruction of people, but this time with a remarkable sensuous edge, that's intimate to the point of hurt.

"Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir/At nights on them banks I'd lie awake/And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take...Now those memories come back to haunt me."

Love will tear us apart and the effect is devastating, the atmosphere perfectly set.

'Point Blank', side three's opener is similarly breathtaking. To an almost jazzy intro (which strangely recalls the David Bowie of Alladin Sane), Springsteen is again restless and hurt as he watches a former lover give up her sense of life. There's an almost lazy feel to the song's introduction.

With a lyrical genius for setting a time, a place and an atmosphere, Springsteen recalls an incredibly romantic incident of them dancing cheek to cheek, building to his anguished accusation that she's been shot "Point blank/right between the eyes".

Then suddenly he's off again, to the scream of raucous guitars and crashing drums, to 'Cadillac Ranch', eulogising "James Dean in that Mercury '49" to the screech of blaring saxophones and pulsing bass lines.

'I'm A Rocker' dances the same territory blowing its sentiments of rock 'n"

roll masculinity gone wild to such humorous proportions that it's impossible not to laugh at. "I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only/I got an I Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely/I got a Batmobile so I can reach you in a fast shake..." It's not only funny, but an effective sideswipe at commercialism gone wrong.

Next one up, 'Fade Away', is a lovely plea for failing and breaking relationship set to a backdrop of shining guitars and dominating organ work, while 'Stolen Car' is a tender drive through a man's broken heart, with Springsteen's understated reverbed guitar saying it all as it gracefully betrays the song's sentiments of fallen hope and love.

'Ramrod' is basically a rock 'n' roll exercise for the E Street Band, and defiantly opens the final side. But even above its formulated settings, Springsteen's vocals sound a little weary and tired at repeating his undoubted love for the car and its potency in rock mythology.

'Price You Pay' is yet another beautiful pop song, replete with aching chorus line. But the album's undoubted killer is the following track.

'Drive All Night' is probably the best song Springsteen has ever written. It's over eight minutes of undiluted passion rolled into a song that tells what it's really like to be in love, and belongs up there with all the great rock 'n' roll love songs.

Garry Tallent's bass, which has been on overdrive for most of the album, starts a slow heartbeat, before Roy Bitten's ethereal piano enters to set the scene for Springsteen's finest moment. The lyrics are simple, the sentiments as pure gold, and yet it's a song that puts shivers down your spine and into your soul.

By the end Springsteen is screaming a scream that sets your heart on fire as he offers himself finally and fully to his chosen one. It nearly drove me to tears when I heard it.

'Wreck On The Highway' takes the album to a touching end; and as with 'Racing In The Streets', Springsteen leads the band into a tantalising melody that leaves the listener grabbing for side one again.

So after two and a half years Springsteen delivers, and does it in a style that's breathtaking. The River fully encapsulates everything Springsteen has ever been about, which ultimately means the music, and he does it with a record that is the most vitally alive work I've heard this year.

It's a full, panoramic screen of rock at it's most glorious and passionate; it's vanities, traditions, devices, pleas, humour and hopes are set triumphantly to a vibrant whirlwind of excitement, victory and defeat.

It pleads for a better world, sees there's no hope for one, cries for that fact and then gloriously recreates it's own version. So nod your trilby to the musicians and producers who produced it, shake the hand of the small man with the guitar, and get to it.
