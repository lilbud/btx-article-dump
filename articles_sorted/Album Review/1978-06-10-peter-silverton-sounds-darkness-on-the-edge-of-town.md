LET'S START with the obvious. It's impossible to approach this album without taking into heavy account the fortunes and misfortunes of this Crown Prince of New jersey in these two years past. Any album can be set against the background of its own history. Only with this one, that history is both better known and more obviously influential.

Leaving to one side for the moment Springsteen's management probelms you can't help but ponder on the results of the time it's taken to record these 10 songs. It is nearly three years since Born To Run. If you're to believe what you read (or, in my case, write) all these songs were re-recorded time after time and they're the final selection of enough recordings for at least a double album – ask the Dilators; they were in the next studio to Springsteen and they recorded a whole album while he was putting the finishing touches to a couple of tracks for this one.

So you can't help suspecting, even before you hear it, that maybe too much has been lavished on this vinyl brainchild. After all, that amount of time and money being expended does suggest indecision and uncertainty. And he's got the cross round his neck of having to follow up an album with the fiery power and consumate panache of Born To Run.

And, unlike that album which was recorded before Springsteen was anything more than just another new Dylan, this one was put together under the full glare of mostly ridiculous expectations. Which is, in more than one way, the core of both its successes and its failures. And further, those successes and failures are often so deeply intertwined as to be almost inseparable.

Basically, Springsteen has grown up. Or more accurately he's got older and moved on from the adolescent concerns of his earlier work to the trials and tribulations of adulthood. Gone are the two-bit hoodlums, would-be hoodlums and sidewalk hustlers down there on E street. Now, the action, like those kids has mostly got itself a wife, two kids, a mortgage and a midnight shift.

If, as many of those who should now have said. Stallone's Rocky was the beginning of a new dominance in American movies, blue-collar rule, Darkness could well turn out to be its rock and roll equivalent. Nearly every track on it is Springsteen's vision of life as it's lived by the inhabitants of (presumably) the industrial sore that goes under the name of New Jersey. In fact, this emphasis on blue collar life is so nearly obsessive that a more apt title for the album would have been the key chorus of the second track on side two, 'Factory': 'It's the working, the working, just the working life'.

As Springsteen groaned at the end of Lou Reed's 'Street Hassle', 'tramps like us, baby we were born to pay', so here it's 'factory takes his hearing, factory takes his life'.

Naturally, it being Springsteen, these visions are just the other side of romance. Kind of a 1970's Woody. Guthrie without any sense of humour. He's so intense about it all that at times, you can't help wishing someone'd give him a horse tranquiliser.

The other side of that is the intensity is exactly what gives him his artistic strength and his individual voice. Unlike his earlier albums, there's few shades of emotion here. It's manic depression all the way down the line. The screaming, desperate 'up' of the almost martial opening track, 'Badlands'. Or the pained contemplativeness of, 'Racing In The Street' (which, as well as having a chorus which is a direct and deliberate echo of 'Dancing In The Street', features the best set of concrete images about cars since Chuck Berry went to jail: 'I got a 69 Chevy with a 396/Fuelie heads and a Hurst on the floor').

Only 'Promised Land', with its Highway 61 organ swirls and harmonica combines both excitement and real feeling. And, even then, the production is on the way to spoiling it. Over the whole album, the production shows the ill effects of too much time. While it's hardly in the Queen league, there are several moments where the continual overdubs and reconsiderations have meant that potential surges have been spoilt because the basic feel has been sacrificed on altar of that one good idea.

However, that makes it sound like a worse album than it actually is. Apart from the fact that the kids have grown up and Brucie now knows his way round the recording studio a little better, it represents no real advance over Born To Run – the songs certainly aren't as good and it only has a fraction of the vitality. And yet, that's rather like saying Chuck Berry only had one tune. Partly true but also meaningless and irrevelent. There's certainly a whole area of music for Springsteen to explore on the basis of Born To Run.

What is wrong though is that he sounds a frightened man, awed by his own history. He even looks like a scared rabbit on the back cover photo. But there's no denying he's capable of a lot, lot more. Hopefully, this album represents a clearing of the decks and now he can come up with the real Springsteen comeback album.

Here's looking at you, Bruce.
