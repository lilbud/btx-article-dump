ON THE SUNNY, balmy Monday this was released the local deejays said, absenteeism in San Francisco broke all records, as tens of thousands of otherwise loyal employees called in sick so they could get in record shop lines to buy it and then go to the beach or Golden Gate Park to spend the day digging it.

Shortly thereafter, National Public Radio reported that, except for the balminess, beach, and Park, the pattern was identical across the land.

Excitement over a record album's release hadn't been so nearly universal since Sgt. Pepper reached the racks on the first day of June, 1967.

Brilliant as he is onstage, The Boss actually didn't seem that likely a prospect for a live album. Artists who go in for a lot more "sweetening" – overdubbed instrumental ornamentation and production flourishes, that is – are actually much likelier, since they sound much more different live. If I'm not mistaken (between the times the album went on sale and my review had to be stapled to the carrier pigeon, I barely had time to listen to the whole new album, let alone old ones), few of the arrangements here are radically different from those on the album versions. And at least one – that of 'No Surrender' – does the song no good at all. Pared way down instrumentally, it sounds like the winning entry in a Dylan-ca.-1963-Composealike contest.

Speaking of 'No Surrender', it was (or at least it seemed) only 72 hours ago that Born In The U.S.A. finally abandoned the charts and airwaves. Isn't it a molecule vainglorious to ask us to virtually buy it all over again?

Maybe not. One of the most amazing things about El Jefe is that he sings as though his very life depends on what he's singing, whether he's singing it for the first or Jillionth time. He breathes new fire into most of the more fiery stuff here, and the brave lads of the E Street Band do their share as well, with the result that even the most over-familiar Born stuff sounds new and vital. 'Cover Me', for instance, here features a dramatically psychedelic introduction, 'I'm On Fire' a couple of very brief but very hilarious Elvis Costello impressions. And 'Born In The U.S.A.' itself is absolutely brutalizing – and even terrifying at the end, when Bruce starts screaming as though possessed by something a great deal less salubrious then usual.

The album reminds us that there is no more thrilling sound in modem rock than that of The Boss roaring (as in 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town') like all 10 of the 10 Mightiest Soulmen in History of the Heroism of Little Guys – or, for that matter, of The Big Man's sax kicking in – over the thunder of the E Street Band. Indeed, there are stretches – such as that including, in order, 'Two Hearts', 'Cadillac Ranch' and 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)' – of sheer rock 'n' roll heaven here, stretches of music so rollicking, so exuberantly performed (just listen to the Mighty Max lose control of himself and turn into Keith Moon at the end of 'Hearts'!) that the little hairs on your goosebumps' necks will stand on end.

But let's be honest with one another. When he got to 'This Land Is Your Land"

and the stuff from the Nebraska album in concert, you headed for the snack bar or lavatory, and I was right behind you. So don't be surprised if you find yourself ducking into the kitchen to whip up a delicious snack when it comes on here. Nor should we be ashamed – it is strictly dullsville. If he were really a nice guy, Il Capo wouldn't make countless defenseless millions of us listen to so much of his generally painful harmonica playing. A little joke, you see.

In concert, 'Seeds', a by-the-numbers expression of rage for the plight of the homeless of Houston set to '50s Guitar Cliche No. 34, struck these old ears as evidence that The Boss was succumbing to the same affliction from which John Lennon suffered for a year or two before and after his Some Time In New York City, whereby one is incapable of reading about any injustice anywhere without feeling compelled to write a song about it. I'm no crazier about it on record.

Nor is 'Racing In The Streets', which I always hoped against hope was a sly self-parody, any less tedious here than heretofore, Roy Bittan's (characteristically) wonderful ivory-tickling notwithstanding.

As far as the new material's concerned, The Boss turns in a rendition of 'Fire' (once a hit for the Pointer Sisters, of all people) that I suspect I'd find unnervingly sexy if I were a woman or gay. I found Patti Smith's 'Because The Night' insufferably overblown, and The Boss's is hardly less so. It's a vivid testament to his stature that he won't be ridiculed savagely for the minstrel-showishness of the Stax classic 'Raise Your Hand'. He doesn't exactly make Edwin Starr's 'War' his own. But 'Paradise By The C' is a witty and rollicking instrumental in the tradition of The Champs' 'Tequila'. And he sings Tom Waite's infinitely corny 'Jersey Girl' with such conviction and tenderness that your heart breaks anyway. Exquisite.

The "Born In The U.S.A." tour stuff, all recorded on digital 24-track equipment, is an audiophile's delight, just as it was live. Such gorgeous highs! Such ambiance! The sound can get pretty mushy elsewhere, though, nowhere moreso than in 'Because The Night' and 'Candy's Room'. And the poor Big Man's sax solo on 'Badlands' sounds as though it was recorded from somewhere on the Arizona State University campus other than where he was playing it

On the repertoire front, it'd've been grand to hear the versions of, say, Manfred Mann's 'Pretty Flamingo', idoi-cum-protege Gary (U.S.) Bonds's 'Quarter To Three', or Yes's Tales Of Topographic Oceans that Bruce and the boys briefly enjoyed playing as their final encore around the turn of the decade, Another little joke, don't you know.

Would it have been too much trouble for somebody to have annotated the deluxe booklet that accompanies the album, so that we'd know where and when the many photographs inside were taken, and exactly who's in 'em? (We know that Neal Preston took the one on the cover, and that, no fault of Neal's, it's almost indisputably the least flattering of anyone ever. How can you help but like a guy who, like The Boss, didn't insist on using the infinitely more flattering one from page 15?)

All together now: We want the movie to which this ought to have been the soundtrack! We want the movie to which this ought to have been the soundtrack!

We want the movie to which this ought to have been the soundtrack!
