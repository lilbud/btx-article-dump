At least in retrospect, it seems as if some artists's record releases 10 years ago carried with them an enormous cultural weight. A disk by the Beatles or the Rolling Stones or Bob Dylan was awaited with all the expectation of a tablet from on high. People defined themselves in relation to the music they heard, and invested that music with a personal, political and visionary importance that seems hard to believe in our more "mellow", realistic 1970's.

Even now, however, there are some artists whose records arouse an expectancy almost comparable to those of the past, and that's certainly the case with the new records by the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen. The Stones have had their ups and downs in this decade, and their future is clouded because of Keith Richards's (he's using the "s" on the end of his name these days) forthcoming trial in Toronto for possession of heroin and cocaine. Still, the band has given signs of life of late in large part because of Ron Wood's joining the group as second guitarist three years ago. Yet the new "Some Girls" album is the first studio disk on which Mr. Wood has played an active role from the outset, and the band's first studio album since "Black and Blue" of two years ago.

Mr. Springsteen's "Darkness on the Edge of Town" has been even more anxiously awaited by his admirers, since it's his first record of any kind in nearly three years. Ever since "Born to Run" of 1975, he's been tied up in legal troubles, seeking to clarify his management and publishing relationships, and thus this new record becomes his first real statement since the huge wave of press attention tossed him up into the public consciousness.

It should be stated right away that eager anticipation is not always the most perceptive frame of mind in which to hear a new album. If one nervously trying to jump to a quick concluskin about something, one likely to worry at it instead of simply enjoying it. "It's only rock-and-roll", sang the Stones a few years ago, and even if one likes to argue that rock can be art, that debunking attitude is worth keeping in mind.

There's another factor that might tend to blunt our appreciation of these two new records in particular. The 1960's were by and large an optimistic decade.

Even if the Stones liked to play the devil role as opposed to the Beatles's angels, their deep-down-dirty affirmations of sexuality and rebellion had a carefree abandon that lifted the spirit. But both "Some Girls" and Mr.

Springsteen's new disk are in some crucial senses pessimistic, even embittered statements, reflecting cruel disappointments on the part of the protagonists.

That all said, these are both still wonderful records, worth waiting for.

"Some Girls" may well be attacked as sexist. "Black and Blue" aroused feminists's wrath because of a bondage advertisement that equated the title with the abuse of an attractive, willing woman, and the second song on "Some Girls" is called "When the Whip Comes Down."

Yet insofar as one can make out the words—as usual with the Stones there are no texts—"Some Girls" isn't so much sexist as sexual, when it deals with sex at all. The main themes of the record seem to be Bianca Jagger and New York.

Mick Jagger approache: the break-up of his marriage iron several angles, from the opening disci song. "Miss You" (Bianca haunt! Studio 54), to denunciations of her fot her soda I pretensions and greed to the final "Shattered", which is both about his own emotional desolation and the decay and decline of New York.

References to this city appear throughout the album, and the record's energy and tension owe much to New York's vital ity. (There's also a song sung in his chat acteristic reedy whine by Mr. Richards that may he a comment or

This is, in fact—for all the complaints in the lyrics—the best Stones record in years. Mr. Richards and Mr Wood (sometimes complemented 1) Mr. Jagger) make for a tight guitar sound, as expected. But this is really Charlie Watts's record as much as anybody's, partly because that estimable drummer isn't cluttered by too much added percussion this time around. Indeed, except for the odd solo here and there this is the first five-man Stones record in a long time, and it benefits mightily from that restriction. Mr. Watts's skills have long been celebrated, and they are in full flower here. He's as solid and exact a rock drummer as there is, but his love for and skill with jazz lends his work a subtlety to which most rock drummers can't even uspire (Keith Moon and Mick Fleetwood are two that come to mind as postable rivals, but there are very few). the result is that even in slowish songs ?? "Beast of Burden"

here).

The music on "Some Girls" ranges from the disco single (which is available in a twice-as-long disco-mixed version) to hard rockers to a fine interpretation of a Temptations song to a curious, almost patronizing country novelty tune with a suddenly moving chorus to slow songs (although there are no really emotive ballads on this hard-rocking record) to the final "Shattered."

Well-established rock artists have evolved definable styles, for all the range they may have found within those styles. A first hearing of the Stones's "Some Girls" may sound a little too familiar—the same basic rock structures, the same guitar chords, the same black affectations from Mr. Jag- ger. It's only later you realize the quality of the songs and the playing and the fact that Mr. Jagger is actually singing better and more carefully than he has often in the past. On the one hand, familiarity can breed contentment; on the other, once you get past the initial shock of recognition, there's plenty here that is new and fresh.

The same is true for Mr. Springsteen, who purveys a genre of rock that this listener has always found a little suspicious—inflated, rhetorical, overblown in the arrangements. The success of Meat Loaf, on whose debut album a couple of Mr. Springsteen's band members played, was enough to make one doubly suspicious, especially in today's climate. Three years ago, Mr. Springsteen seemed a revitalization of rock; now he's been outflanked by the puband punk-rockers. And in fact a first, casual hearing of the new "Darkness on the Edge of Town" may seem like a rerun of Mr. Springsteen's past work. There are the same melodramatic images of New Jersey low-life, the same clinging but elusive girls, the same cars, the same scuffling along night-time streets, the same hoarse yowling (even actual wordless howls), the same saxophone solos, the same gritty guitar solos, the same piano arpeggiations, the same slightly repetitive, tuneless melodies, the same fixed, neo-spectorian murkiness of production.

But once again, after one listens for awhile, Mr. Springsteen turns out to have made a fine record. As he himself put it a couple of weeks ago, the scenes may look the same, with the same characters and the same frames of reference, but actually they've evolved over the past three years. "Darkness on the Edge of Town" is full of the passage of time, and even devolves into an unadorned heartbeat at one point.

His legal difficulties and the cynical blandishments of sudden fame have clearly embittered him. The songs here are full of explicit allusions to his re- cent troubles—"1"m caugnt in a crossfire, that I don't understand ... I want control right now",\* for instance, from a song called "Badlands" that opens both the album and his current concerts. The characters are lost and desperate, trying to retain the idealism and excitement of their youth but surrounded by the ghosts of former friends who have disappeared, sold out or settled down. The peak of his despair is reached on the most striking song on the record (and one of the most compelling of his entire career), entitled "Adam Raised a Cain", in which the refrain sounds very close to "race of cain"

and images of cursed abandonment, fratricide, betrayal, guilt and James Dean ("East of Eden") are projected in searing, incendiary music, punctuated by tribal screams from the band.

Yet "Darkness" isn't all black. Mr. Springsteen is too irrepressible a force for that, and the sheer passion of his singing and his and the band's playing redeems not only the record but even, maybe, the whole idea of bombasto.rock (at least for him, if not for Meat Loaf).

Both the Rolling Stones and Mr. Springsteen have made disks that are ultimately life-giving, for all the bitterness they entail. Partly that's because of their own vitality and strength. But in a larger sense it's because rock music, when it's executed with the fervor of these two records, is itself lifegiving. Which in turn suggests that the breathless expectations of the 1960's may not have been so foolishly, naively optimistic, after all.
