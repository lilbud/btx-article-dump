IT TOOK me a long time to get to feel comfortable with Bruce Springsteen's music and then, an album or so after I'd overcome the hype. I began to get just plain tired of his greatness being rammed down my gullet.

I mean, a lot of the bloated double The River was like self-lampoon, while Nebraska was a good notion gone cold in the acoustic wasteland. From most other tykes these would have been acceptable records, but BS had his rep to live up to. Bleak?

Blistering! If his twofer would've made a good single LP, and his solo set a neat 45, then Born In The USA is just exactly what it ought to be: a bloody, unbowed, magnificent album. The similarity of the title to the legendary Born To Run is no coincidence; but if Broooose is no longer innovating, at least he's polishing and perfecting his craft. If you let notions of 'classics' be replaced by objectivity then this might be the best Springsteen album ever.

The title toon is a wildly declaimed, drum-punctuated rock anthem, and if it lacks the irony of a Chuck Berry geography lesson it's hardly a major fault in a blast this full of life. 'Cover Me', a raucous shuffle melodrama full of self-consciously 'hot' blueso licks, can't follow with much hope, but then nothing could – Springers has learned the art of pacing his albums.

Lyrical analysis is out for me, mostly. In spite of a heavy rep in that department, I think most people hear this stuff as radio rock, car-motorvating music...and this is a pinnacle of that genre. Most of the tunes here could be covered by other artists, the way Beatles LPs used to be stripped within days of release by young hopefuls.

Take 'Darlington County', f'rinstance, a glorious "shaaanahhlaahah" singalongaBruce rocker full of 'comin' of the Lord' zeal. It'll probably turn up on The Rock Gospel Show. And any one of those meowling and puking Stray Cats-type bands could do with the trad r'n'r of 'Working On The Highway', all punchy cajun organ alternating with lines about gals 'n' retribution.

There are moments of restraint, though. 'Downbound Train' is full of lonesome whines and empty beds and the fine melody simply drifts away where, in less sensitive paws, a brutal guitar finale would've been inserted like a pornographic shot stuck into a movie for the Jap market. Even more subtle is 'I'm On Fire', belying the title with a faint, fragile "ooooo-hoooh" howl.

For me, however, Bruce and the E-Streeters have to be firing on all cylinders to involve my double-hemisphered walnut. Like 'Bobbie Jean', painfully nostalgic ecstasy with blurting sax from big Clarence; if it wasn't so darn great, it'd approach self-parody.

Not so with 'Down Down Down', a hit single if ever I heard one: modern rock riff guitar, amazing drum sound...the title is the hook and the master is in complete control of his vocal abilities. This is the core that justifies most of the hype dumped on BS by his admirers. And there's still the fat keyboard- injected baseball story of 'Glory Days', the 'Dancing In The Dark' single and 'My Hometown', which hints at a '24 Hours To Tulsa' start and then just fades (nicely) to grey.

The album, when it lands in your shops, my sources tell me, should have a twelfth cut in addition to the ones on this sneaky advance schmexclusive tape I have. It's called 'No Surrender' (probably!), but even without it I can safely put my jewels on the railway tracks and say that Born In The USA is a killer-diller, a record that all but the most sullen outsiders will warm to as well as the diehards. 'Dancing In The Dark' shows it most: Bruce has been listening to the radio, and now he's made a record to fit there.

Don't touch that dial!
