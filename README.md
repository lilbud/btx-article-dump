## Intro:

This repository contains a backup of the "The Articles Thread 1972-2023" from Backstreets Ticket Exchange forum. A thread started and largely maintained by a user named "Beazle" from 2012 until 2023. The point of the thread was simple, act as a single repository for as many Bruce Springsteen related articles as could be found.

This is an important resource. Probably close to one thousand unique articles about Bruce going back to the very beginning of his career, until 2023 before his current world tour kicked off. Album and Concert Reviews, Opinion Pieces, Essays, even a college thesis paper or two. Big thanks to Beazle for starting and maintaining the thread for 11 years (which I think could be considered an eternity by internet forum standards.)

Every article in the thread was copied and/or transcribed from the original source. Whether that be a website, newspaper, magazine, transcript of an audio/video interview, etc. In many cases, this thread contains the only version of these articles still on the internet. And not only have they been preserved, but freely accessible for everyone to read. Not locked behind a paywall, or still only available in print (which ranges from easy to near impossible to access today). Also, many of these articles were copied from websites which don't exist anymore. If it wasn't for the efforts of Beazle (and any other contributors to the thread), its safe to say many of these would be lost media.

Sure, many of these articles are still available somewhere online, but nowhere else have they been compiled like this.

Every one of these articles is a little snapshot of history. Whether it is how critics reacted to Bruce's albums at the time of their release, the opinions people had about his music, how his music affected different people, or how his concerts were received at the time. There's articles pondering where Bruce would go after Greetings, or the musician he would become in the future. Even a number of interviews with Bruce, which are an important resource all their own. Its interesting coming across now-famous articles, like the Time and Newsweek articles from 1975, or Jon Landaus now infamous "I have seen the future of rock and roll" review of Cambridge 1974.

There is a longer section detailing the history and process involved in this project, including the tools I used. That has been moved to the `project_history.md` file in this directory.

## A Note About Structure

The layout might be a bit of a mess, no real nice way to do it. I created a spreadsheet of all the articles, which is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q1MAtXpeRgChFk1YMZ40GQM6_X0Ir2AXUmrI75BQqRY/edit?usp=sharing). You can filter by article type as well as author and category, or just search using CTRL+F or the Sheets search.

There is also a python script included, which was used for this project. It's something of a mess, as it was thrown together while I went. If you replace the paths then you could also mess around with the renaming if you wanted.

## Conclusion

As of publishing this repo, it should be mostly "done". Only one article from the thread could not be found anywhere, which is listed in the `missing.md` file. I might at some point look into converting everything to PDF and throwing that up as an alternate download option, but for now the MD files should do.

The Google Sheet is something of a half-measure. Seems to be the most user-friendly thing at the moment.

Also this is hopefully the first step towards a larger Bruce article/media archive thing. I have some additional plans and projects I'm working on, just have to finish and find the best way to present them.
