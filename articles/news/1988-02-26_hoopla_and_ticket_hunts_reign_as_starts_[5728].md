WORCESTER - The bumper sticker on the back of the van in the middle of the city yesterday afternoon said it all -- "This is Boss country."

Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band descended onto central Massachusetts last night and the most often-heard question around the Centrum arena was, "Tickets for the Boss?"

The words were uttered by those selling tickets and those desperately seeking seats who were part of the excited crowd awaiting the arrival of Springsteen for his group's first concert in nearly three years.

A Springsteen concert is not simply another rock show. It is an event. "No one else who comes here creates this much excitement, this much hoopla", said Linda Holstrom, who works at a clothing store in the shadows of the Centrum.

"He's definitely the hottest ticket in town."

Throughout the afternoon, preparations for last night's opening show of Springsteen's "Tunnel of Love" tour were being made. The scalpers kept one eye out for prospective customers and another eye out for police -- uniform and undercover.

Those without a ticket were debating how much they were willing to pay. "Money is no object", said Bill McKay, who drove five hours from Freehold, N.J., just for the chance to see Bruce. Springsteen was born and raised and Freehold.

"I'm willing to go about $200 but I want to get the best seat possible. He's a fellow hometown boy. Of course, I'd pay that much to see him."

About two hours before the show, scalpers were asking $150 to $250 per ticket.

The price among some ticket hawkers dropped to about $100 as the 7:30 p.m. start drew near.

Springsteen attracts one of the most loyal followings of any rock star. Fans like Steve Ticks, 28, who flew into Worcester from Los Angeles yesterday afternoon. And he did not even have a ticket.

"I'll go anywhere to see the Boss", Ticks said as he added that he has been to 147 Springsteen shows. "I've seen him in Tokyo, Ireland and all over the United States."

Ticks said he can afford to track Springsteen around the world by using his savings. "Bruce is the only thing I spend money on", said Ticks, who slightly resembles Springsteen. "And the only time I take a vacation is when Bruce tours."

Ticks said he was turned on to Springsteen when he was only 14 years old and his brother played with Springsteen at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, N.J., one of the clubs at which Springsteen got his start. "Because I was only a kid they would let me hang around and watch Bruce. This was before he became so big."

And despite his rise to stardom, Springsteen in the eyes of his most fervent fans has not changed. His eloquent commentary on the hopes and struggles of blue-collar and middle-class America have remained at the core of his nine albums.

Debbie Slaughter, a 33-year-old fan who recently moved to Boston from Dallas, said, "He hasn't sold out. He has remained true to his music and most importantly to himself."

Slaughter, who was about to see her third Springsteen show, said she did not become a true fan until about four years ago. "He doesn't touch people in Texas the way he does up here", she said.

"I hadn't heard much about him. I mean until just a couple of years ago, Texas was enjoying real affluence. No one was interested in listening to the things Bruce sings about. About the people who have been left out or left behind. Up here it's different."

As for why she arrived at the show five hours early, Slaughter said, "I wanted to come and scout out the scene. I got the day off so I wanted to come early and start getting excited. I like building up the show."

Slaughter also came to the show alone. "A Bruce concert is personal between me and him. I don't want to have anyone yelling in my ear."

Ticks, who was seen walking around the Centrum several times looking for tickets, said, "Bruce sings about all the things I feel."

Ticks met and talked with Springsteen during a concert in Arizona in 1980 -- the year Ticks' mother died. "When I met him I told him his music changed my life, and then he asked me how", Ticks recalled.

"I was floored when he asked that. I said that you can't follow and listen to someone for so long without it having an impact. He thanked me and then he said in that great voice of his, 'Keep the faith.' That really helped me get through my mom's death. He is a great and decent man."

While most of the early arrivals at the Centrum yesterday where those without tickets, Brian Chamberlain, 28, and his brother Edward, 30, of Rhode Island, who arrived in downtown Worcester at about 3:30 p.m., didn't have to worry about getting into the show. "My girlfriend got us tickets in New York", said Edward Chamberlain. "She didn't even have to wait all that long."

Ben Gallagher and John Bristol, both 21 of East Greenwich, Conn., didn't have tickets but came loaded with large bills. After making several attempts they landed two tickets for $300.

"What's 300 bucks?" said Bristol as a happy smile crossed his face. "A couple of days' work to see Bruce. It's a fair deal."

Perhaps Springsteen's most faithful fans are those from the New Jersey shore, where he grew up and from where the inspiration for much of his music comes.

William Smith and Stephen Bumball have a special affection for Springsteen.

They own and operate the Asbury Park Rock 'n' Roll Museum.

The museum, they said, contains memorabilia that spans Springsteen's career and contains items such as rare photos, Springsteen's high school yearbook and the guitar Springsteen used in his high school band, "The Castiles."

"For me, Bruce's music is very personal", Bumball said. "He's singing about places and things I can relate to very easily. He's singing from our perspective. He's another Jersey Shore kid just like me."

Smith said Springsteen visited the museum last year and gave it his blessing.

"He loved it. He didn't want to leave."

Shortly before the ticketholders stormed in, Ticks was getting closer to securing a ticket. "Don't worry", he said. "You'll see me in there."
