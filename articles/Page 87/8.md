London always gets something special from Bruce Springsteen. In 1975, when he was still a promising but marginal figure, it was where he found himself confronted for the first time by the hard sell that record companies sometimes inflict on their contracted artists. The lesson was taken to heart. On his return, six years later, he tore into Wembley Arena like a man bent on exorcism, as if London was where he had to prove to himself, and to the world, that he had achieved success without compromising the integrity that he works so hard to define, and by which he stands or falls.

On Wednesday evening, in the vastness of Wembley Stadium, he chose a rare moment of calm towards the end of his three-hour concert to remind his 72,000 listeners of the importance he attaches to that historic relationship. It was one of several signs that, despite his new status as the tabloid newspapers' favourite pop sensation, he continues to respond primarily to the whisper of his conscience.

There had, after all, been plenty of scope for doubt. Was Born in the USA not too calculated a simplification of his virtues? Who among his old admirers had not been dismayed by the announcement that his 1985 British tour would consist only of stadium concerts? Could it not be said, in fact, that the past year had been the story of a sell far harder than anything attempted in 1975?

Perhaps in pop music there are no alternatives. Perhaps the only thing to be is more popular than you were last year. At the end of the first hour on Wednesday, as Springsteen and the E Street Band took their customary break, the sun was bright, the temperature high and the crowd cheerful, yet for all but the few hundred crushed closest to the stage there was no feeling of true engagement at all.

Only a brand-new song, a steel-braced road narrative called 'Seeds', had illuminated a set otherwise deficient in surprise and zest. No, this was just another rock 'n' roll picnic, just another hot ticket. It was like Wimbledon: you see more on the television, and you don't get your pocket picked.

Then the second half began and, as the shadow of the stadium rim crept across the field, he began to enfold us in his magic. Where even 'Thunder Road' had sounded coarse and perfunctory, now 'Hungry Heart' and 'Rosalita' shouted their joy to the darkening sky. Prefaced by a heartfelt retelling of his old Elvis story, the first batch of encores came and went in a rush. For the final gallop, ending with 'Twist and Shout', he was joined by his former lieutenant, Steve Van Zandt, whose humorous presence had been missed.

Now the promise was being fulfilled, the contract kept, the stadium reduced to the dimensions of a club. Now even those in the far distance could forget the way the ropy sound lagged behind the image on the great video screens. But - bigger? louder? brighter? - what happens next?
