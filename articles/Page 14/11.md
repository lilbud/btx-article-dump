After the U.S. Men's Olympic basketball team beat Spain for the gold medal Sunday, the arena blared Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A", while U.S. fans whooped it up.

They've got to stop using that song.

"Born in the U.S.A." is not a patriotic song. It's not a happy song. It's not about winning or triumph or anything positive. It does rock, for sure, and the title says "U.S.A." But that's where the good times end.

Springsteen's song is about a troubled Vietnam vet who can't find a job, and our Veterans Administration won't help him.

```
Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man said son if it was up to me
Went down to see my V.A. man
He said son, don't you understand?
```

This is the thanks he gets after the Army sent him halfway around the world to kill the enemy in Vietnam. For the cherry on top, the lyrics contain an offensive description of Asian people. That's the Olympic spirit, all right.

And just when the song can't get any more depressing, we learn that the vet's brother was killed in the war.

```
I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone.
```

"Born in the U.S.A" is an angry protest song against the U.S. government. Stop using it to celebrate victories by U.S. athletes. It's not helping us win friends.

A couple of years ago, I was in Williamsport, Pa., covering the Little League World Series. They played "Born in the U.S.A." before a game between a team from Connecticut and - this is unbelievable - a team of Asian kids from Taiwan.

I told Little League officials to listen to the words to "Born in the U.S.A." A week later, I got a letter from the president of Little League International. They'll never use that song again. If Little League can wise up, surely the Olympics can follow.
