FIFTY THOUSAND guests were gathered at a twilight party in this straitened, immobile summer, and the host knew just what was on their minds.

Bruce Springsteen had collected from the front rows in Giants Stadium the signs that fans have been bringing to concerts lately, scrawled with the names of the songs they hoped to hear. He chose from among them one that, he said, he had performed live only twice before, "Held Up Without a Gun."

"I'm going to dedicate this to what it cost you guys to drive here", he said, and then ripped so fast through the song — the shortest of the night — that it was over almost as soon as it started, much like the summer journeys of many in the crowd.

Gas at $4 a gallon. Mortgages past due. Canceled flights and airport chaos. Looming layoffs and truncated vacations. Where do you go and what do you do when everything seems to be keeping you in one place, with a lock on your wallet?

One lesson of this grounded summer is that if you can't get away from home, at least you might take a new look at it. Another — for those who may not have lived here long enough to learn it already — is that New Jersey is a much bigger place than it seems: You don't have to go far to get someplace new, which happens to be the lesson at the heart of Mr. Springsteen's work, too.

When the great French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson was shooting images for a photo essay of the United States, he spent much of his time here. "New Jersey is America", he said by way of explanation. Our state sits at the center of the Northeast Corridor like a natural history exhibit, a compendium of dioramas from other states, conveniently arranged at short distances from each other.

You can see Vermont in the green and rounded hills of Morris County, New Hampshire in the craggier reaches of Passaic County, the Finger Lakes of upstate New York in Sussex County. You can see Cleveland and Pittsburgh in Trenton and Newark, Niagara Falls in Paterson. Martha's Vineyard is in Ocean Grove, Nantucket in Cape May. Las Vegas is in Atlantic City, Churchill Downs in Monmouth Park. The San Joaquin Valley is in the vegetable farms around Vineland and Bridgeton. Island Beach State Park is Cape Cod, without the houses.

Drive through the drowsy, shady small towns that hug the banks of the Delaware River and you might be tracing the upper reaches of the Mississippi. Warren County noses so far toward Pennsylvania that it is almost indistinguishable from it. The Palisades echo the Oregon coast, the salt marshes of Cumberland and Salem counties the coastal lowlands of the Carolinas. The piney, sandy expanse of Fort Dix might easily be in Georgia.

Even here in the Meadowlands, if you had detoured on the way to the concert, you could drive down an unmarked road into the marshes, stand amid the tall swaying grasses under a huge, unbroken sky, and imagine for a moment you were in Nebraska.

And what is the Shore — the part of New Jersey that Mr. Springsteen evokes more sweetly than any other — but Southern California, with a Labor Day expiration date?

"So how has your summer been going?" Mr. Springsteen asked the audience, and the answer they roared back seemed to say that things hadn't been too bad after all, no matter how many places they hadn't been.

Staying in one place can show you some other things, too, beyond these scenic postcards. You get to see how things turn out. New Jersey gave Mr. Springsteen — whose roots in the state predate the Revolution, and who has raised his family here — a rich store of raw material, of characters and stories and wisdom, from which to build the songs that 50,000 people knew the words to when he turned the microphone to them.

"I've always found it deeply resonant holding the hands of my kids on the same streets where my mom held my hand, swimming in the same ocean and taking them to visit the same beaches I did as a child", he said in May, when he was inducted as an inaugural member of the New Jersey Hall of Fame. "That's what New Jersey is for me. It's a repository of my time on earth. My memory, the music I've made, my friendships, my life. ..."

You don't have to go far to get someplace new — over and over again, he pounded out the same message with his band. I was in the upper tier, and all through the evening, I could glance up and see the lights of the planes heading in and out of Newark. They were going somewhere else, but so was I.
