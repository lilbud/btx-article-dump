I have already done three posts of Bruce Springsteen songs, covered by women, but it was really no trouble to find enough great covers to put together a fourth.

First of all, lots of people have suggested covers I wasn't aware of: I've included many of them here. Second, there are some covers that didn't even exist when I put together the first set (in early 2015), such as the two Boss-written songs from the late 2015 Introducing Darlene Love album. And third, I've stumbled upon some more great ones on my own.

Below are videos for the 14 new additions to the series, in alphabetical order (by artist). (UPDATE: There have been three more installments in this series, bringing the total number of songs to 150. Here is an index to all the songs.)

Deana Carter: "State Trooper"
Shawn Colvin: "Tougher Than the Rest"
Catherine Feeny: "I'm on Fire"
Hem: "Valentine's Day"
Jill Hennessy: "No Surrender"
Moa Holmsten: "Highway 29"
Lucy Kaplansky: "Thunder Road"
Darlene Love: "Just Another Lonely Mile"
Darlene Love: "Night Closing In"
Lera Lynn: "Fire"
Hanna Morgan: "No Surrender"
