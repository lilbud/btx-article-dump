BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN'S 'Tougher Than the Rest' is a sombre, unforgiving song typical of his recent Tunnel of Love album. It describes love not as an answer to problems but as a reward for survivors of those problems, and when he sang it at Philadelphia's Spectrum March 8, he gave it a slow, deliberate arrangement that featured ominous synthesizers and a funeral march beat.

Just as the song ended-with Patty Scialfa singing a wordless wail over Springsteen's forlorn harmonica solo-a rainbow-colored beach ball bounced from the crowd onto the stage. The contrast seemed to crystalize the underlying tension of the evening: the collision between the stark realism of Springsteen's new music and his audience's expectation that he would still be the same old partying hero they've always known.

When the song was over, Springsteen stepped back to the mike and said with no- nonsense bluntness, "Do me a favor and get rid of those fucking beach balls." There was a moment of stunned silence, but the beach balls never reappeared the rest of the night.

Springsteen's Tunnel of Love Express Tour, which arrives at the Capital Centre April 4-5, is a brilliant evening of music and performance, but it is quite different from the celebratory, triumphant juggernaut of the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, which came through our area three times in 1984 and '85.

The Born in the U.S.A. album was Springsteen's final breakthrough to superstardom on the mythic level of a Presley or Beatles, and the subsequent tour had the air of a conquering march to the sea that rewarded and reaffirmed the tenacious faith of his longtime fans. By contrast, this new tour has a more restrained, more individual flavor, as if Springsteen were challenging those same fans with his most piercing questions about myths in general.

Springsteen, now 38 and married, seems to be deliberately extricating himself from his own self-created image as the eternally young rocker, always ready to lead his fans down the highway to a "promised land" on the Jersey Shore where the friendships of youth are cemented forever by rock'n'roll. Instead it seems he's trying to recover his individual voice so he can speak to his audience rather than speaking for them.

The stardom that Springsteen achieved four years ago is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, providing a shared experience for such a broad, diverse audience is an invaluable service in a society divided so many other ways. On the other hand, sustaining that consensus often requires so much universalization that the songs can lose their bite.

Springsteen learned this the hard way. The Born in the U.S.A. album was strongly influenced by his increasingly left-wing populism, but he deliberately avoided making those sentiments explicit to keep the record accessible to the widest possible audience. In doing so, he allowed right- wingers from Ronald Reagan to George F. Will to misinterpret the title song as a bit of flag-waving patriotism.

So on this tour, Springsteen is no longer trying to be everybody's friend. In Philadelphia, he did a vicious parody of right-wing preachers which included the declaration that "Pat Robertson can't save my soul; in fact, Pat Robertson can kiss my ass!" He did a ferocious version of 'Roulette'. the apocalyptic song about nuclear power on the B-side of his new single. Instead of laying the blame on technology itself, Springsteen laid the blame on the political and industrial leaders who "keep on playin' roulette with my life, roulette, with my kids and wife."

He included a pounding, stop-and-go version of Edwin Starr's 'War' that ended with his 12-member band and the sold-out arena shouting, "War! Hunh! What is it good for?" and Springsteen shouting back, "Absolutely nothing!" Back and forth the shouts went, building and building until an exhausted Springsteen whispered, "Absolutely nothing."

At that point, everything stopped still for a moment as the singer raised his hand above his head. When he whipped it back down, drummer Max Weinberg kicked off the familiar riff to 'Born in the U.S.A.', which the beefed-up band seemed to play louder and harder than ever before. It was the kind of moment that rock'n'roll was made for. Moreover, the juxtaposition of the two songs insured no one would misinterpret 'Born in the U.S.A.' as a pro-Rambo anthem this time around.

On any Springsteen tour, the songs change every night, but this March 8 show was consistent with the new tour's emphasis on recent material. The 22 songs he performed before the encores included eight songs from Tunnel of Love, four songs from Born in the U.S.A., six original songs that he has never put on any studio album and only two songs from the '70s.

Even some familiar old songs were radically rearranged. 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)' was transformed from a straightahead frat-rocker into a loping rockabilly/boogie number. Before he sang 'Born to Run', he acknowledged that it was his favorite song; "This song has kept me company on my search", he said, "and I hope it has kept you company on yours." He then performed it as a solo acoustic folk song, Woody Guthrie-style. As he played a slow harmonica solo at the end, it was the audience that sang the "woh-woh-woh" refrain.

He unveiled three songs that he has never released on any record. 'Light of Day', the song he wrote for the ill-fated movie of the same name, was done in a joyously rocking arrangement that easily topped Joan Jett's film version. 'I'm a Coward When It Comes to Love' revamped the themes of the Tunnel of Love album into a comic singalong number not unlike 'Pink Cadillac'. Set to a reggae groove, 'Part Man Part Monkey' made the point that the "creationism" controversy has less to do with science than with sex; mimicking an ape on stage, Springsteen sang like a man with no shame.

"The Boss" has added five horns for this tour-including three alumni of Southside Johnny's Asbury Jukes. For much of the concert, though, they were a subtle presence; they thickened the textures more often than they played standard horn charts. The familiar E Street Band was in top shape, with Patty Scialfa taking a more prominent role on the new songs than she ever had before and with Max Weinberg working harder than anyone. Maryland's own Nils Lofgren took several lyrical guitar solos; he was especially effective on a haunting version of 'One Step Up'.

The heart of the show was the Tunnel of Love material. The concert opened with the album's title cut, played with the disorienting swirl of an amusement-park ride. Just as disorienting for may fans was the unheroic, demystifying look at love in the songs. Perhaps the best example of this was 'Spare Parts', a jagged-edge blues that told of a pregnant young woman deserted by her would-be fiance.

As the woman in the song took her baby down to the riverside and considered the comforts of suicide, Springsteen knelt by the edge of the stage as if it were the bank of a river and lowered his voice to a scary whisper. Only then, when he had taken his audience to the brink of despair, did he stand up and belt out the final lines about the woman going home and pawning her engagement ring for some "good cold cash." It was a powerful moment, but it was no place for beach balls.
