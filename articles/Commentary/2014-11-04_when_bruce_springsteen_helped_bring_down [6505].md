With the 25th anniversary of the fall of the first break in the Berlin Wall coming later this week, I posted here at few days ago about a landmark concert by Bob Dylan in East Berlin two years before that, in 1987 -- and a secret police (Stasi) document on the event. Dylan gave a rather lackluster, apolitical performance, but a year later Bruce Springsteen took quite a different turn.

Springsteen arrived to play to his biggest crowd ever -- at 300,000 nearly four times what Dylan drew. And the climax of his show was a song that Dylan didn't choose to sing: "Chimes of Freedom."

As the No. 2 editor at Crawdaddy for almost the entire decade of the 1970s -- and an early promoter and friend of Bruce Springsteen -- I've always been fascinated by claims that he played a part in helping to "knock down" the Wall. There's even a recent book about it, Rocking the Wall (Berlinica), also based partly on Stasi files. This is a general subject I'm starting to delve into deeply for an upcoming book and film.

Springsteen's epic four-hour show, beyond the outdoor concert grounds, was beamed to millions more via state television. You might ask why, given the decades long official repression in the Communist state. But tensions and anger among young people had been building in East Germany as controls loosened in some other Eastern bloc nations in the era of Gorbachev's "glasnost." State officials deemed the occasional concert by a Western rock star as a way for the kids to blow off steam rather than take to the streets in protests. So they allowed the party's youth organization to invite a few rockers.

But Springsteen that day in July 1988 went much farther than others. "It was a nail in the coffin for East Germany", one fan who attended told The Guardian years later.

Bruce played one of his very long sets -- 32 songs -- and delivered an impassioned speech in grade school but effective enough German: "I'm not here for any government. I've come to play rock 'n' roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down." Apparently Bruce decided at the last minute to change his original word, "walls", to "barriers." But the Dylan song that followed includes the key reference to "while the walls were tightening."

A German historian, Gerd Dietrich, would tell Erik Kirschbaum, author Rocking the Wall:

_"Springsteen's concert and speech certainly contributed in a large sense to the events leading up to the fall of the wall. It made people ... more eager for more and more change ... Springsteen aroused a greater interest in the west. It showed people how locked up they really were."_

And Springsteen would later reflect: "Once in a while you play a place, you play a show that ends up staying inside of you, living with you for the rest of your life", he said. "East Berlin in 1988 was certainly one of them." And showing another side of his political interests: Not long ago, Bruce penned the preface for my book on Bush, and media, failures on Iraq.
