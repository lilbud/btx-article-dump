In July 2017, I posted the fifth in NJArts.net's "Springsteen Covered by Women: The Best of the Best
"series, bringing the total number of songs to 99. I thought I might stop there. But occasionally I've been made aware of new covers, and now, more than two years later, I have enough for a Part 6. So here are 21 more.

I'm particularly glad to add songs that haven't been covered among the previous 99, including "Adam Raised a Cain "(Alabama Shakes), "Jungleland" (Patty Griffin), "We Take Care of Our Own" (Nalani & Sarina), "Matamoros Banks" (Amy Laber), "Two Faces" (Terry Radigan), "Drive All Night" (Sharon Van Etten) and "The Fever" (Sanne). (UPDATE: There have been two more installments in this series, bringing the total number of songs to 150. Here is an index to all the songs.)

Some of the songs were suggested by readers in the comments section of the previous posts, and on Facebook, so thanks to everyone who helped out in that way. (I was not able to include some suggested songs only because no YouTube video is available.)

So here are the 21 songs, in alphabetical order by the artist's last name, or the band name.

Alabama Shakes: "Adam Raised a Cain"
Daniela Andrade and Gia Margaret: "Dancing in the Dark"
Anna Maria Blixt: "Dancing in the Dark"
Clara Bond: "I'm on Fire"

Amy Laber: "Matamoros Banks"

and "Born to Run"
Little Mazarn: "Dancing in the Dark"
Nalani & Sarina: "We Take Care of Our Own"
Lauren O'Connell: "Dancing in the Dark"
