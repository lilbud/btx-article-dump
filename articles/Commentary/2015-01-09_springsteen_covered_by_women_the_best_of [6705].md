On Wednesday, I did a post on some of my favorite Bruce Springsteen covers, by women. In it, I asked for suggestions for more, and people came up with so many good covers --- many of which I had not heard before --- that I decided to put together this follow-up post, compiling videos for them.

Since a couple of people have brought it up, I want to mention that I did not include Patti Smith's "Because the Night" since she co-wrote it, and I therefore consider it a collaboration, not a cover.

Also, in some cases, people suggested videos for which YouTube videos do not seem to be available, so I was not able to include those. (UPDATE: There have been five more installments in this series, bringing the total number of songs to 150. Here is an index to all the songs.)

So here they are. (Lots of good stuff here. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions!)
