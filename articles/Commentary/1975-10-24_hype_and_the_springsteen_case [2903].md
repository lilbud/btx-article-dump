The air is thick these days with talk of "hype." Hype is the music-industry term for promotion, and it has two rough meanings. One is any sort of public enthusiasm that can be used to promote an artist's career. The other is the specific effort on the part of an artist's backers to engender that enthusiasm.

Hype is a topic of current discussion because of the extraordinary attention being paid to Bruce Springsteen. Those who don't like his music have sometimes taken the position that all the enthusiasm for him is either hype or a result of hype.

If one writes favorably about Mr. Springsteen, one's words can be picked up and used in advertisements. If other publications are swayed by a review, then the review becomes part of a process that leads to another piece. Even pieces that decry hype are themselves hype in this sense, especially if they are prominently displayed on the cover of a national magazine.

But the hint behind the hype talk is that the enthusiasm isn't honest, and at that point the infighting among Mr. Springsteen's fans and foes begins to get a little dirty. Either the enthusiast doesn't really like Mr. Springsteen all that much, but is swept along by the herdlike enthusiasms of others. Or he is actually in the pay of Mr. Springsteen's backers.

Any time anybody doesn't like something that is popular, the temptation is to attribute the success to sinister machinations. Lovers of oldtime adult pop liked (and still like) to think of all rock 'n' roll as a plot on the youth of America. And today, with a "return to melody" and the re-emergence of late-fifties and early-sixties pop veterans onto the charts again, the old antirockers can disguise their distaste as the latest thing.

But the fact remains that nearly all the people who have written enthusiastically about Mr. Springsteen have done co simply because they love his music. Maybe they are all backward-looking rock nostalgists; the idea seems misguided, but at least it is legitimate argument to make.

What they surely are not however, are mindless v:ctirns of an unprecedented promotional -campaign or hype. by Columbia Records. Columbia denies that it spent any more money on Mr. Springsteen's "Born to Run" album than en those of several other of its major artists. And in any event, rock writers are a fairly cynical breed when it comes to such hype: The number of artists who have disappeared ignominiously on Columbia and other labels, can attest to that cynicism.

At this point, the enthusiasm for Mr. Springsteen has reached such a point that one does have to worry about a backlash. But ultimately, Mr. Springsteen's future depends on what it has always depended on: his own ability to withstand the pressures of success and his own ability to keep on writing songs of the same quality he's written so far. If he can do that, he'll stop being a "hype" and start being a legend instead. There are still plenty of pennle around who don't like Bob Dylan, but you don't har much talk about hype him.

Another artist Columbia is busily hyping is David Essex, who made his formal American debut last night at the Bottom Line. Earlier this week in his hotel suite, Mr. Essex seemed remarkably seraphic about cracking the American market---a market that has become increasingly difficult for British stars to win over ever since the craze for British acts in the post Beatles nineteen-sixties.

"I'll do it in a gentle way", he said, smiling faintly and sleepily. "If they don't like it at the Bottom Line---well, maybe we won't come back again. Some people come from England and expect to be big in America automatically."

There will be a new Dylan record to coincide with the singer's forthcoming tour after all---a tour Mr. Dylan's people are still being nervously secretive about, but that continues to be planned. Columbia will next week release Mr. Dylan's song about Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, the imprisoned boxer.
