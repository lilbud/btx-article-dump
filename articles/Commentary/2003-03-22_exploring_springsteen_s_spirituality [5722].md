Ask believers their favorite religious music and you'll get a range of answers: triumphant Christmas hymns, the deliriously joyful anthems of gospel, perhaps Gregorian chants for those of classical bent.

For the Rev. Jim Symynkywicz, it's Bruce Springsteen.

To the world, Springsteen is a temporal troubadour, known for singing about the plight of working-class people and towns. But Symynkywicz, minister of Stoughton's First Parish Universalist Church, sees a spirituality, and sometimes an explicit religiosity, in his music, notably on Springsteen's latest album, "The Rising", a meditation on perhaps this generation's greatest challenge to faith - the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

First Parish's Free Market of Ideas program explores topics outside the mainstream, and on a recent night, a half-dozen Springsteen apostles sat in chairs arranged in a horseshoe in the church parlor as Symynkywicz offered his interpretation of "The Rising."

"For some of us, Springsteen is our religion, or at least an important part of our religious authority", he said. One purpose of religion is to bind together a community, and Springsteen's music "has done that as well as any Scripture can."

Raised Catholic, Springsteen lapsed from his childhood faith, but like many Americans after Sept. 11, he started taking his family to church, Symynkywicz said.

The attacks, however, didn't suddenly turn him into a spiritual- minded lyricist; "My City of Ruins" - included on "The Rising" for its obvious tie- in, but written before the attacks - has references to church, prayer, and "the Lord", plus the repeated resurrectional exhortation, "Come on, rise up!"

In "The Rising", a number of songs not only skate on the surface language of religion, they plunge into its themes, from the stark reality of evil and the pain it inflicts, to the faith that those can be overcome.

Some songs weld despair and hope. Consider "Into the Fire", a paean to New York firefighters who charged into the World Trade Center and never came out.

The song does not sugarcoat the sorrow of that day: "It was dark, too dark/to see, you held me/in the light you gave/You lay your hand on me/Then walked into the darkness/of your smoky grave."

But there is also the devotional refrain: "May your strength give us strength/May your faith give us faith/May your hope give us hope/ May your love give us love."

"'Into the Fire' is a prayer, of course", Symynkywicz told his audience. Even people who aren't churchgoers arguably could utter "Into the Fire's" refrain comfortably.

But if you buy Symynkywicz's interpretation, then another song, "Mary's Place", is unabashedly religious. It's also blatantly bouncy, an upbeat party song that Symynkywicz views as addressed to the Virgin Mary.

The song describes "Eleven angels of mercy sighin' over that black hole in the sun" on Sept. 11. Then comes a call to faith - "My heart's dark but it's risin'/I'm pulling all the faith I can see" - and a description of a community:

"Familiar faces around me/ Laughter fills the air/Your loving grace/surrounds me.... I lose myself in the crowd."

This is a congregation, with Springsteen offering religious community as a way to cope with tragedy, Symynkywicz argued, "and I think he had the church in mind when he wrote it."

The carpeted coziness of the First Parish parlor with its tiny, respectfully quiet audience could not have been further, physically or emotionally, from the panicked, smoke-clotted chaos of New York's streets. The link was Springsteen's lyrics, which for this audience and many others - "The Rising" has sold almost 2 million copies in the United States - evoked that day's trauma.

Dawn and Van Eswara are proof of that.

The young Newton couple are Springsteen devotees; their first dance at their wedding was to his "Thunder Road" - "and it was really long", she recalled.

They had never considered Springsteen a spiritual artist, per se. Yet they listened - their 2-month-old daughter, Carly Rose, slumbering at their feet in her carrier - to "You're Missing", in which a victim's relative catalogs details of every day life that are suddenly haunting in her absence: "Pictures on the nightstand, TV's on in the den/Your house is waiting, your house is waiting/For you to walk in, for you to walk in/But you're missing."

Inevitably, the Eswaras said afterward, their thoughts drifted to each other and their children as they listened to those words.

"It made me really sad", said Dawn. "You can hear a song when you're single that doesn't resonate the same way as when you're sitting here with your husband and your baby."
