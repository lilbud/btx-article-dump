Long before their hero took to the stage in Melbourne on Saturday night, the Springsteen fans who call themselves the Bruce Buds were making plans in lands near and far. From Sweden to New Zealand, from New York to Hoppers Crossing, the people who make up one of rock music's most devoted fan bases were doing what they have done many times before: moving heaven and earth to give themselves one more night in the presence of the man they call The Boss.

It doesn't matter where he's playing, if they can get there they will.

"I stopped counting after I hit 250 shows", says Pamela Scerba, from New York, who first saw him at Madison Square Garden as a teenager in 1980.

Sonja Strandberg from Sweden is only 21 but has notched up 16 concerts, and is seeing eight of the 11 shows on this tour. "It's the way he gives everything to his audience", she says. Strandberg's Bruce memories are more potent than most: twice he has picked her from the crowd to join him on stage for Dancing In The Dark, an echo of Courtney Cox in the famous film clip from 1984.

Such moments are part of Springsteen lore, and no fans take the accumulated legends of a performer's career as seriously as the Bruce Buds. His concert set-lists are shared and scrutinised with forensic intensity, to discover which obscure album cut he has played, or for surprises such as his roof- raising opener in Perth: AC/DC's Highway To Hell.

Two nights before the first Melbourne show, as his fans gathered at a pub in the city, what was obvious was not only their shared passion for the music, but the other joys they've found in a community spanning continents and generations.

Jon Walsman, from Los Angeles, said: "I've loved Bruce since I was about 13 and I love him more now because of the people I've met ... the friendships that I have made with people across the globe. So I'm grateful to not only the music and the man, but also to all the people who've been so kind over the years."

Similar bonds have been forged locally: the organisers of the event, Michael Egan and Russ Barclay, first met through a shared love of St Kilda Football Club. Then they found they had something else in common. When Springsteen announced this tour, Barclay decided to emulate an idea well-established abroad.

"I got a text from Russ saying why don't we do a meet-up of Bruce fans like they do in the UK?" Egan says.

The night attracted scores of fans, swapping tales from the road and eagerly anticipating this weekend's AAMI Park concerts.

Among them: Eden Reiss, from Auckland, first among equals. On her hand was branded the number 1, signalling she was first in line last week, giving her the honour of being first through the gates in the race to the foot of the stage - the "pit" where the true loyalists gather at Springsteen's feet for his three-hour shows.

Reiss says the coup was well-earned - she spent Tuesday alone outside the stadium to make sure she'd be front and centre. She first saw him as a kid in Germany in 1988; a spark was lit and she's seen him more than 100 times since.
