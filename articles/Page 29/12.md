The other big comeback of the year was that of Bruce Springsteen, who returned after a three‐year legal entanglement with a fine album and an even finer tour. Mr. Springsteen's records still aren't up to the level of his live shows, but that's partly because as concert artist he's so overwhelming. It's not difficult for this writer to say, in fact, that as a performer (as opposed to a composer, a singer, a guitarist, a musician, a record‐maker or whatever) Mr. Springsteen is the best he's encountered in rock‐and‐roll, ever. That's partly because Mr. Springsteen is so engaging a personality onstage, partly because he's so effective all‐round in every facet of what it takes to be a great rocker, partly because he works so conscientiously at his craft, and partly because the very essence of his music and his presentation is so wonaffirmative.
