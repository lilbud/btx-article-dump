THEY compare watching Springsteen to a religious experience, and 32,000 Melburnians got seriously Brucified at AAMI Park on Saturday night.

It started incredibly with Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder joining the Boss to open proceedings with a cover of AC/DC's Highway to Hell, staying around to sing part of the Springsteen classic Darkness on the Edge of Town.

Then mid set because he'd been here last year and didn't want "to do the same thing again", Springsteen casually announced the E Street Band would play the entire Born in the USA album from start to finish, a first for Australia.

It was a moment the phrase "Like a Boss" was invented for.

Playing his biggest album in its entirety, he added rarely aired hits including Cover Me, I'm on Fire, Glory Days and My Hometown.

It was another example rewarding fans with a bespoke concert each night with wildly differing song selections.

This tour also sees the guitar dream team of stalwart Stevie Van Zandt joined by newbie Tom Morello. The latter's work on High Hopes was jaw dropping, while Van Zandt helps steer the cover of Australian band the Saints' Just Like Fire Would.

Most of all it's Springsteen's passion that's infectious. Last night from a sea of signs requesting songs Springsteen played the "very obscure" cover Joel Blon, noting it was a "good call". It was followed by the "not so obscure"

Hungry Heart.

Springsteen is in a league of his own and it is heartening to see how many kids are at these shows witnessing how it's done properly.

This was more than just a Springsteen show. Melbourne rocker Dan Sultan is poised to break into the mainstream with his new album and was perfectly at home in a stadium.

The reformed Hunters & Collectors were the perfect opening act and sounded seriously incredible, adapting Throw Your Arms Around Me into a plea for compassion towards asylum seekers.

AAMI Park again proved what a great venue it is for the right act, with great outdoor sound.
