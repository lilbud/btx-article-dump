Bruce Springsteen turns 60 in September. That is a fact. So what happened Sunday night at Philips Arena had to be some sort of consensual hallucination, because there is no way a guy that age can put out that level of energy for nearly three hours.

Surrounded by full-throated fans his own age (a 40-year-old was a mere pup at Philips on Sunday), Springsteen fed off of their rowdy adulation, delivering a show that proves boomer-oriented rock 'n' roll can still tear it up.

Springsteen and his E Street Band are ostensibly touring to support his new album, "Working on a Dream", but his set lists haven't been overcrowded with the new songs (some of which have elicited shrugs, even from fans). Instead, this seems to unofficially be the Havin' A Blast Tour, with surprise cover tunes, unexpected deep cuts and a sense of youthful enthusiasm.

One of many highlights was the Stump the Band segment, in which fans bring big signs printed with the names of songs the E Street Band has rarely, if ever, played in concert. Springsteen chose "96 Tears", the garage-rock classic by Question Mark and the Mysterians. "You think the greatest bar band in the land doesn't know '96 Tears'?" he teased. They did, in a loose way, although Springsteen didn't try to hide that he was reading the lyrics off a stage-level Teleprompter.

Other fan signs requested songs that aren't part of the tour's set list, which led to a rare and stunning "Jungleland" on Sunday. Fans stood, but not to dance; it was more like rising for the national anthem. You can tell how deeply the hard-core Springsteen fans are moved or impressed by the volume of "Bruuuuuce!" at any point in a show, and "Jungleland" got the Bruuuce-iest response of any song.

Always a relaxed natural with his crowds, Springsteen goofed by handing his mike over to kids in the audience to sing along on "Waitin' for a Sunny Day"and even let them play his guitar on "Born to Run", the evening's closer (before the five-song finale).

Other notes:

- Springsteen's wife and band member Patti Scialfa missed the Philips show (and several others) after falling off a horse Wednesday; she's OK, just out of action. He dedicated "Kingdom of Days" to her.

- Drummer Max Weinberg's son Jay sat in for a few songs, very forcefully, and helped raise the rock quotient of "Radio Nowhere" considerably.

- Finally, the Boss just flat out looks great: pumped, toned, all in black. Some of the guys in the band look their age; maybe bringing in young Jay is a step toward an ageless Springsteen fronting the Sons of the E Street Band.
