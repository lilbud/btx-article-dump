America's beloved blue-collar guitar slinger earned a hero's welcome Thursday as Bruce Springsteen and the legendary E-Street Band paid a power-packed courtesy call to their northern neighbour.

One by one, they strode cockily aboard a wide, Spartan stage bathed in ash- grey light, the adoring crowd saving its loudest ovations for the Boss and the "Big Man" himself, sax man Clarence Clemons. "Evening, Toronto", Springsteen chortled after kicking off his only scheduled Canadian stop with gun-barrel renditions of Sept. 11 anthems The Rising and Lonesome Day.

"It's nice to be back here over the border."

Clad in his trademark black jeans, vest and plaid flannel, Springsteen stood with his back to the crowd, his arms hanging out in gunslinger fashion and face glistening with sweat, as his E-Street stalwarts churned through Never Surrender, a national anthem from 1984's Born in the U.S.A.

A chilling version of Candy's Room, the minor-key masterpiece from the 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town, offered an unexpected respite before another sombre trio of songs from The Rising, a moving -- if a tad heavy -- musical homage to his homeland's terrorist scars.

After a stirring acoustic version of Empty Sky with wife and guitar player Patti Scialfa sharing vocal duties he segued effortlessly into You're Missing and Waitin' on a Sunny Day.

But it was the classics this eclectic, middle-aged crowd came to hear, and they weren't disappointed.

Pink Cadillac was the night's surprise crowd favourite, followed by an energetic reading of Worlds Apart off The Rising, followed by Badlands -- the ever-robotic drummer Max Weinberg keeping efficient time from his lofty drum riser -- and the soulful She's the One, from 1975's legendary Born to Run.

Together with the kerchief-clad guitarist and new-found SopTogether with the kerchief-clad guitarist and new-found Sopranos star Steven Van Zandt, Springsteen mugged for the cameras as he steered an appreciative audience through the classic back catalogue before mugging a little for the cameras.

"I think it's quittin' time; I think it's Canadian bedtime", a spry, if sweaty, Springsteen jeered after two hours on stage. "What time is it?"

"Boss time", sneered Van Zandt.

With that, the house lights went up and Springsteen and company, not a pyrotechnic or fog machine in sight, commanded the attention of a capacity Air Canada Centre with nothing but the title track from Born to Run.

Indeed, as he introduced what history has come to know as one of the tightest bands in rock, Springsteen might have been a tiny bit put out by what at times seemed a downright lethargic audience.

"Rule number 1: the music's got to be raucous", he growled. "Rule number 2: You've got to get up off your ass. You ain't at home."

With that, and flanked by Van Zandt and diminutive guitar legend Nils Lofgren, Springsteen tore into another round of crowd faves that included Born to Run's Thunder Road and Dancing in the Dark, the 1984 single that made him a megastar.

But the Boss didn't leave town before moistening a few eyes and pitching a few causes.

There was even a commercial of sorts, this one for Toronto's Daily Bread Food Bank -- the second-largest food bank in Canada -- before a moving, piano-and- vocals turn of My City of Ruins, Springsteen's personal New York love letter.
