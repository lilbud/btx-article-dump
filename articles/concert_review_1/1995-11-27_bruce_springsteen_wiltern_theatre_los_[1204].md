"I KNOW THIS IS LA", ANNOUNCED BRUCE Springsteen at the start of his concert, "so I hope I don't have to go out there and confiscate your phones."

The enthusiastic crowd tittered, jam-packed into LA's smallish Wiltern Theatre and relishing this, the opening night of Springsteen's first-ever solo acoustic tour. Local boy Bruce - no longer a newcomer, now an Angeleno of some duration - had just advised potential BRROOOCE screamers that his forthcoming songs needed to be listened to by an attentive, quiet audience.

Well now, there's a thought. Less than a week after local media were trumpeting the enormous sales of the just-released Anthology 1, typically at the expense of Springsteen's latest - issued the same day and thus compared saleswise with peculiar glee (initial score at one retail account: Beatles 2,000, Springsteen 40) - here was a man politely asking his audience to sit down and shut up. Good man, that Bruce Springsteen.

But the man can hypnotise. As he began singing the title track of his aggressively stark 'The Ghost Of Tom Joad', holding a guitar and lit mostly by sparse stage spotlights, the celebrity-packed crowd instantly hushed. For this was surely how the album was meant to be heard: not on a car stereo, with traffic lights and blaring horns distracting, and not on the radio, sandwiched between Sheryl Crow and Don Henley. In person, onstage, one-to-one, ultimately troubadour-style, dumb as that sounds. There are scant melodies on the new album - some would say about three - but Springsteen's way of drawing you in is a hook no-one else can provide. In his hands, little is plain or ordinary.

Few can fault Springsteen for his sense of pacing; indeed, most of the new songs were delivered between stripped-down versions of more familiar ones. Along with second number 'Adam Raised A Cain', a total of nine older tracks were acoustically reworked, some of them drastically. Noting that his next song had been misinterpreted - "sort of like 'Louie Louie'", - and adding that as its writer he could get in the "last word", the man took slide to 12-string and knocked off 'Born In The USA' without once singing its lyrically-prominent title. This, presumably, because it had been appropriated here in the past by right-wing imbeciles lacking any sense of irony. Also missing: that line about killing "the Yellow Man". Political correctness? Tribute to an apprehensive albino Jamaican rapper? You decide.

For the most part, the older songs Springsteen chose to sing - 'Nebraska' and 'Darkness On The Edge Of Town', say - were a perfect thematic fit with his newer work. That theme in full: life sucks and then you die. A far cry from the joyful tinge of his recent work - but then again, 'Living Proof' and '57 Channels' seemed drawn from what appears to be his own very happy personal life. The Ghost Of Tom Joad, on the other hand, seems drawn from books, articles and films - several of which are courteously listed on the album's liner notes for your perusal.

The night's big question then, at least for me, was whether Springsteen could convincingly sing these songs detailing the woes of others so obviously far- removed from him. The big answer, to his credit, was that of course he could. Taking a seat for the first time midway through the show, he sang four new songs detailing the lot of the illegal Mexican immigrant; here so close to the border, that topic is a hot one both politically and, for many, personally. Beginning with 'Sinaloa Cowboys' - his grim tale of methamphetamine-cooking Mexicans drawn directly from the pages of the Los Angeles Times - Springsteen sang convincingly, heartrendingly and, truly, not far removed in spirit from Woody Guthrie's own 'Deportee'.

The Guthrie comparisons, inescapable, are not far off-base, actually. More than a few whoops of BRRROOOOCE were heard when the singer began his first encore with 'Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?', but the wordy New Jersey tunesmith who plopped that song dead-centre on his 1973 debut album no longer keeps or needs his old thesaurus. "Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel nymphs", he sang then. And now? "Come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands/Lay my head down on the pillow/And go driftin' off into foreign lands." These are not the lyrics of a man looking to sustain a career as a pop singer; they're the work of an artist writing songs for the ages. Three encores, a new song - 'Dead Man Walking', apparently from an upcoming Tim Robbins film - and not a single phone confiscated from the audience. Where I come from, they make movies about this sort of thing.
