Bruce joins his first band, The Castiles

1966

May 16 The Castiles record their first single in Bricktown Studios, NJ. The single contains two songs, "Baby, I" and "That's What You Get". Both songs are written by Bruce and George Theiss, singer for The Castiles. Only 5 copies of the single were pressed and only two are said to still exist.

1967

June 19 Bruce graduates from highschool.

1968

After The Castiles break up, Bruce forms a band called Earth.

Bruce attends classes at Ocean County College but after a petition handed in by classmates claiming Bruce was too weird, Bruce realizes college is not for him and quits.

Bruce's parents, Adele and Douglas decide to move the family to California. Bruce however remains in Jersey and moves to Asbury Park staying at a friends', Tinkers, surfboard factory. Asbury Park would also eventually become Bruce's musical home.

1969

Springsteen's most famous early band, Steel Mill is formed. The band was first called Child but when they found out another band went by that name, they changed it. The songs are mostly lyrical experiments and often include long instrumental (guitar) parts. The lineup of Steel Mill mostly consists of Danny Federici, Vinny Lopez, Robin Thompson and Steve Van Zandt.

1970

Steel Mill quickly gains popularity playing outdoor gigs for up to a few thousand people. Steel Mill take a trip to California were they record a few demos and are offered a record deal, but they surprisingly turn it down. In late January, Bruce breaks up the band after playing one last gig on January 23 at The Upstage Club in Asbury Park.

1971

Bruce experiments with different band formations and names including The Bruce Springsteen Jam, The Togues and Dr.Zoom and The Sonic Boom. The latter band would often have people on stage playing monopoly.

1972

Bruce has formed a band called The Bruce Springsteen Band and they play various gigs in New Jersey and Virginia before breaking up.

May 1 Mike Appel introduces Bruce to John Hammond, a Columbia talent scout responsible for signing and discovering Bob Dylan and Bessie Smith amongst others. Bruce plays a short set in Hammond's office who is so impressed that he organizes a proper audition for Bruce for that same night at the Gaslight Club in New York. The audition is a success and Columbia offers Bruce a recording contract. The famous Hammond demos are recorded at the CBS Studios in New York. Two of the songs recorded, featuring Bruce (solo) on guitar and piano, will eventually be released on Tracks.

Summer Bruce records his first record called "Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ". Later Bruce would say the following about the title: "Like the main reason I put Asbury Park on the title of the album was because they were pushing for this big New York thing, this big town. I said, "Wait! You guys are nuts or something! I'm from Asbury Park, New Jersey! Can you dig it? New Jersey!"

November 12 The E-Street Band plays its first official show with Bruce. The band consisted of Clarence Clemons, Garry Tallent, Vini Lopez and Danny Federici. David Sancious whom played on the Greetings album, joins the band in the summer of 1973.

1973

January 5 Bruce's debut album, "Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ" is released in the US.

Spring Bruce and The E-Street Band tour the East and West Coast in the US in support of Bruce's first album. In May and June they are the opening act at a few Chicago shows. The large arena crowds don't give Bruce the response he'd been getting at his own shows and they are very indifferent to his playing. Bruce vows to never play arenas again.

Summer Bruce and The E-Street Band record "The Wild, The Innocent & The E-Street Shuffle".

November 5 Bruce's second album, "The Wild, The Innocent & The E-Street Shuffle" is released in the US. Both "The Wild" and "Greetings" aren't commercial successes, but Bruce does gain critical attention and acclaim.

1974

While on tour in support of "The Wild, The Innocent & The E-Street Shuffle", Bruce fires Vini Lopez and replaces him with Ernest "Boom" Carter.

May 9 Music critic Jon Landau, Bruce's future manager, attends a show at the Harvard Square Theater in Cambridge, Mass. The show inspires Jon to write an article saying "I saw the future of rock and roll and its name is Bruce Springsteen". A year later, the quote would be used in an extensive promotional campaign.

September 9 Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan join The E-Street Band replacing Ernest Carter and David Sancious on drums and piano respectively. Both Max and Roy were hired after replying to an ad in the Village Voice.

Fall Bruce goes on tour and Suki Lahav, a violinist joins the band until March 1975.

1975

March-July Born To Run, the album, gets recorded at the Record Plant in New York. During these sessions, Jon Landau, who has become Bruce's friend, takes on a bigger role and slowly moves Mike Appel aside as Bruce's manager. Steve Van Zandt sits in on a few sessions which leads him to join The E-Street Band.

July 20 The release of Born To Run is still six week away, but Bruce goes on tour anyway.

August 13-17 The famous Bottom Line stand takes place. These are regarded as some of Bruce's (and The E-Street Band) most important shows of their careers. The shows were attended by many music critics and one of the shows was even broadcasted over the radio. Bruce won many fans with these shows and managed to convince many critics of his music abilities.

September 1 Bruce's third album, "Born To Run" is released. It will be Bruce's first commercial hit LP with critics applauding his strong lyrics and playing. The LP would go on to make the top 10 and the title track would end up in the Top 40.

December 31 The Born To Run Tour ends with one final show on New Years Eve.

1976

"The Chicken Scratch Tour" starts in the spring. The tour is called that way because there seems to be no logic behind the venues played and the tour crosses different states going back and forth between cities, mainly playing small and unlikely places.

April 29 After a show, Bruce and Steve take a cab to Elvis' house. Bruce decides to climb the gates and starts running up to the front gates when he's stopped by a guard who escorts Bruce back to the gate.

July 27 Bruce sues Mike Appel accusing him of fraud, amongst other things. Two days later, Mike Appel files countersuit. The lawsuit would last until the spring of 1977 and prevent Bruce from entering a studio.

At one point he spotted his ex girlfriend, Lynn Goldsmith in the crowd and dragged her onto the stage humiliating her by telling the crowd how she's his ex girlfriend. According to Bruce Lynn had violated an agreement they both had about her taking pictures of him (she came too close to the stage) Bruce also threw a birthday cake into the crowd. Part of Bruce's performance would end up in the No Nukes movie and on the album.

Fall "The River" sessions are still going on. Bruce nearly releases an album titled "The Ties That Bind" but at the last minute decides to keep recording new songs.

1980

September After recording more than 60 songs, The River sessions come to an end.

The lyrics are no longer solely about blue-collar life struggles and now also cover emotional turmoil's. The album was recorded during a three-week period, at his home in Rumson, New Jersey and only featured some members of the band on various tracks. Clarence Clemons does not appear at all.

May 1 Bruce and Julianne Philips' divorce is official.

Summer Bruce spends the summer club hopping along the Jersey shore making numerous, usually unannounced guest appearances.

October 18 Bruce called up the E-Street Band members and told them "to be free to accept any other offers". The press jumped on it and claimed things such as "Bruce fires E-Street Band!" The band hadn't really been a part of Bruce's recording career since 1982 when BITUSA was recorded. They weren't used on Nebraska (sessions with the band led to nothing) and they were only occasionally used for Tunnel Of Love. Clarence Clemons took the news the hardest comparing it to a divorce. Eventually he opened up a few clubs in NJ and California. The rest of the band too moved on. Max Weinberg who said that it was weird he'd no longer play the music he'd been playing for most of his adult life, started his own band, the "Max Weinberg 7" and landed a job on the Conan O'Brien show.

Garry Tallent became a producer in Nashville, Roy Bittan bought a recording studio in LA, Danny Federici built a studio in Colt's Neck, NJ and Nils Lofgren concentrated on solo projects and toured with a band.

November 15 Bruce appears on the cover of Rolling Stone

November 16-17 Bruce performs at two Christic Institute Benefit shows. Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Brown are also present. The two emotional solo acoustic shows rank amongst Bruce's best even though he was extremely nervous not having performed for a long time. At the start of both shows he asked the audience for some quiet while he was playing because it'd been a long time and the clapping and cheering would put him off. Bruce premiered a total of 10 new songs he'd been working on.

1991

June 8 Bruce and Patti get married at their Beverly Hills home.

Summer The Human Touch album is nearly completed and ready to be released in December. Bruce however records one more song called "Living Proof" dealing with the birth of his son and starts writing more songs. He continues recording and makes what would become the album "Lucky Town".

May 9 The band makes it first public appearance on Saturday Night Live in NY when Bruce appears on live television for the first time.

June 5 A rehearsal show in California shows another real glimpse of what the shows would look like. The shows are rock and gospel oriented and mostly concentrates on the new material with an old hit here and there. Bruce himself is a calmer and settled person who seems happier with himself now that he's become a family man. He also doesn't shy away from making fun of himself and how his albums are doing on the charts (or aren't doing, as they are not the chart toppers he's had before. At one of the shows during the tour, a magazine with the billboard chart would get thrown on stage and Bruce would make comments about how his albums are slipping down the chart)

June 15 The tour, Bruce's first in 4 years starts in Sweden, Stockholm. There is lots of media coverage and a nervous band takes the stage, playing a 3-hour show.

They get through it alright, but the fans have mixed feelings. Born to run is missing from the shows for the first time since 1975 (only to reappear a few days later in Milan, Italy). Some fans crave for the "old days" with The E-Street Band.

August 6 Bruce appears on the cover of Rolling Stone

July 23-August 13 Bruce is back in NJ to play his first shows since 1985. The 11 Meadowlands shows are a new start as many of the new songs are replaced with older, favorites.

July Bruce records a show for MTV called "Bruce Springsteen In Concert: "MTV UnPlugged". Or at least that was the idea, as Bruce decided his touring band wasn't ready and played only one acoustic song (Red Headed Woman) which was the first song. Afterwards, Bruce plugged in and played his normal set.

October The Tour continues. Even though both albums have dropped out of the top 200 and are considered to be failures, Bruce puts more emphasis on the new material.

November 18 "In Concert: Plugged" is broadcast for the first time.

February "Human Touch" gets 2 Grammy nominations for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song but does not win either.

March 23 A rehearsal show in Red Bank, NJ for a new European tour takes place. Since then, Bruce started pulling out songs, not played since the 70's, if played live at all, and unreleased songs only found on bootlegs see the light of day.

After years of rather predictable and well thought-out live shows setlist- wise, Bruce suddenly loosens up and becomes completely unpredictable.

March 31 The European tour opens in Glasgow, Scotland. "Lucky Town" is shown on MTV.

The show now starts with 3 acoustic songs showing us a glimpse of were Bruce is headed in the future. The shows have changed a lot since the last legs.

April 24 "In Concert: MTV Plugged" is released as a limited European only release. A US release would not be available until 1997.

June 1 The last show of the tour takes place in Oslo, Norway

June 24 Bruce sets up two benefit shows in NJ and NY. The NJ show at the Meadowlands is called "Concert to fight hunger" and becomes a four hour-long party atmosphere with guest appearance by Clarence Clemons, Max Weinberg and Steven Van Zandt. As Roy Bittan and Patti Scialfa were already present, half of the E-Street Band was on stage, fuelling rumors and raising hope that Bruce wants to set up a reunion.

June 25 It's David Letterman's last night. He tells the audience that there's really only one guest he's wanted to have on the show for all those years and that tonight that would all change. With that, Bruce walks onstage and plays Glory Days with Paul Shaeffer and the David Letterman band, even jumping on Paul's piano. A very relaxed and funny television appearance.

June 26 The second benefit is in support of the Kristin Ann Carr fund. At one point during the show, Terence Trent D'Arby is booed by some people. (It's been said those people misunderstood Bruce and believed Clarence would come onstage). An angry Bruce rushed through the rest of the show and thus ending the tour and the collaboration with a different band on a sad note. The tour was worth it for most of the fans, although some complained about the way the older songs were played ("it's just not the same...")

Summer-Winter Bruce takes some well-deserved time off.

Johnathon Demme asks Bruce to write and record a song for his movie "Philadelphia". Bruce comes up with "Streets of Philadelphia" which he records in his home studio. The song would be his biggest and most successful hit of the 90's.

He also wants to record some new material and with only 72 hours notice, Bruce gets the entire E-Street Band back into the studio at the Hit Factory in New York. The entire band had not been together in the studio since 1983 and Nils Lofgren had never recorded with Bruce and the band together. The sessions were recorded on video and would later be released as an 80-minute documentary called "Blood Brothers".

February 21 Bruce and the band perform at Tramps in NY. They are there to shoot a video (directed by Jonathan Demme) for the new single "Murder Incorporated". The video shoot turns into a 2-hour gig with many favorite songs played. Hopes of a definite reunion and even tour are not far away.

July 9 In a strange, odd move, Bruce turns up at Café Eckstein in Berlin, Germany for a video shoot for "Hungry Heart".

Instead Bruce and family, decides to spend his holidays with Tom Hanks on the Canary Islands.

The acoustic tour begins in New Brunswick, NJ and will continue for the rest of the year, taking Bruce to different cities across the US. The old hits are completely ignored and the shows are focused on the dark, bleak, new material.

The public didn't like it." Bruce also took the time to praise and thank each and every E-Street Band member who were not eligible to be inducted with him.
