When not touring the world's stadiums, was Bruce Springstreen to be found morosely grouting his bathroom tiles and ruefully reflecting upon his broken marriage? Indeed he was not. There was a new album to record, surprise gigs to be played, and no small amount of hell to be raised. Phil Sutcliffe ploughs his way through a mound of discarded beer bottles and busted guitar strings to chart the indefatigable troubadour's progress since 1987's Tunnel of Love.

It's nearly three years now since Tunnel Of Love and Springsteen addicts are suffering I withdrawal symptoms. Of course, rumours of an "October album, tour next year" nature abound, but substantiation, as ever, will remain impossible until Springsteen and manager Jon Landau sense that perfectly pontifical moment.

The suspense is both killing and thrilling as, throughout the '80s, Springsteen's contact with his public was a unique combination of extremes: the full-bore Greta Garbo "I want to be alone" dedication to privacy interspersed with recklessly untrammelled, unmindered sorties into the sweaty embrace of every person's ordinary life.

The Tunnel Of Love campaign, its unscheduled accompaniment of tabloid uproar about Bruce's marital problems and the lawsuit from a couple of former roadies alleging, essentially, that he was a mean old sod, and then the Amnesty International Human Rights Now! world tour all exposed Springsteen as never before and in ways that were, for the first time, only partly within his control.

Great music at chosen times and places was no longer the whole experience for Bruce-watchers. His love life, previously unremarkable, was suddenly "scandalous", open to fervid speculation by gossip columnists and, of course, fans committed or not. Not only that, but he was coming out politically too, defining himself, cutting away the scope for speculation always offered by the storytelling songwriter.

For the Bruce-watcher it's all rather worrying. What is he up to? Is he living happily ever after with Patti Scialfa? What does all this ligging about with rock'n'roll celebs over the past couple of years mean? What will his wider political awareness and encounters with world music do to him?

Most of all, Bruce-watchers just want to know he hasn't lost it...

1987

October 10: Following the latest outburst of unannounced Springsteen guest spots with New Jersey Shore bar bands --- often a hopeful sign --- Tunnel Of Love is released worldwide. Critically, it is welcomed, though with some surprise.

His 1985 marriage to Oregon-born model and actress Julianne Phillips had provoked expectations of more than a little lyrical romanticism, but only 'All That Heaven Will Allow' offers any hint of domestic bliss. The Q reviewer observes of its melancholy tone and overt scepticism about the nature of relationships that "The darkness at the edge of town is seeping into the master bedroom". In reality, though, there seems nothing to indicate that the songs are autobiographical: American paparazzi have caught Julianne emerging from a gynecologist's office and, on the strength of that, the tabloids report her "pregnant" and Bruce "delighted".

The only shadow case on Springsteen in the Breeding months is that, through a story sold for international syndication, his former senior roadies Mike Batlin (credited with "recording" the home-made album Nebraska in 1982) and Doug Sutphin have accused him of dismissing them for accidental errors like damaging his canoe. Springsteen denies it all, but the two promise to sue.

The album goes straight to Number 1 in Britain, America and many other countries, but sales will fall well short of 1984's Born In The USA and 1986's Live boxed set.

October 22: At St Peter's Church, New York, Springsteen attends the memorial service for talent spotter supreme John Hammond, who signed him to CBS in 1972 and also discovered Bessie Smith, Billie and Bob Dylan. Springsteen sings Dylan's 'Forever Young' solo. .

October 31: At McLoone's Rumrunner, a bar and restaurant in Sea Bright, N.J., Springsteen and most of the E Street Band trick or treat a Halloween crowd by showing up in black and wearing hangmen's masks to take the stage. They play a set which includes the first five performances of some Tunnel Of Love material and the acoustic 'Born To Run', which was to be a feature of the following year's tour.

November 6: A bunch of kids knock on Springsteen's front door in Rumson, N.J..

They say there's an open day at the school across the road and would he like to come over? He says, Sure, and soon he's onstage with local stalwarts the Fabulous Greaseband, giving it some 'Carol', 'Lucille', 'Twist and Shout' and 'Stand By Me'. As matters get nicely out of hand, Bruce hollers, "Keep it down, my wife's asleep across the street!"

November 20: Springsteen turns up at the Stone Pony, one of New Jersey's few clubs surviving from the legend-making eruption of the early '70s, and joins Bobby Bandiera's band to round up the usual suspects --- 'Carol', 'Little Latin Lupe Lu' and so on. Bandiera is the man who would have replaced Miami Steve Van Zandt on guitar in the E Street Band if Springsteen hadn't preferred Nils Lofgren. His consolation prize seems to be that he's emerging as Bruce's favorite jamming soulmate.

December 7: Along with Paul Simon, Harry Belafonte and others, he attends a Carnegie Hall, NY, tribute to late political folkie Harry Chapin, strums one of his songs, 'Remember When The Music', and recalls Chapin trying to enlist him for some forgotten cause: "Harry said, You know, I play one night for me, one night for the other guy. And later on, when I was trying to put my music to some pragmatic use, I remembered what he said. Not being bent on extremism, I was not as generous as he was. And now we live in times that are pretty shattered... And you kinda sit back, not cynically but truthfully, and say, well, maybe all men are not brothers. Maybe we'll never know who or what we are to each other."

December 13: At a Madison Square Garden, NY, benefit for homeless children organised by Paul Simon, Springsteen joins backing vocalists including Billy Joel, Lou Reed and James Taylor for Dion's "Teenager In Love', then introduces his acoustic 'Born To Run' with a version of a homily he will soon deploy around America and the world: "I wrote this song about 15 years ago.

It's about a boy and a girl that thought they wanted to run and keep running and never stop. And at the time I thought that was me and maybe it was. But I woke up one morning and realised that I wanted a home. And nobody wants or deserves to be homeless."

December 25: Springsteen calls E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg and tells him to get ready to tour. Whether he said "Happy Christmas" too is not recorded.

1988

January: Six weeks of rehearsals begin.

January 20: At the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame awards ceremony held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, NYC, Springsteen delivers Bob Dylan's induction speech.

He says: "The first time that I heard Bob Dylan I was in the car with my mother and on came that snare shot that sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind - 'Like A Rolling Stone' ... Bob's voice somehow thrilled and scared me, it made me feel kind of irresponsibly innocent and it still does ... The way that Elvis freed your body, Bob freed your mind and showed us that just because the music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellect."

February 25: The Tunnel Of Love tour opens at The Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts, like all the American venues an arena (i.e. capacity up to around 20,000) rather than a stadium. Springsteen plays for just over three hours and includes eight of the intimate songs from Tunnel Of Love. Some old favourites like 'Backstreets', 'Jungleland' and 'Thunder Road' are missing.

February 28: The second Worcester concert and Springsteen talks to a couple of journalists in his dressing room: "I just felt I'd have to drop all the cornerstones of my set. You just can't come out and push people's buttons with old songs. I was interested in personalising my music. You have to re-invent yourself... My writing tends to get easier as I've gotten older because I tend to be more open to it and less afraid of it, less afraid of what's going to come out. The only trick to writing a new song is you have to have a new idea.

And to have a new idea, you've got to be a bit of a new person."

April 1: Nassau Coliseum, N.Y., and Bruce is feeling bolshie. "Don't vote for that fucking Bush!" he robustly advises at one point.

April 5: Second night at the Capitol Centre, Andover, Maryland, and there's a handwritten note on perfumed vellum waiting in Springsteen's dressing room when he comes offstage. It's from Fawn Hall, notorious as Oliver North's document-shredding secretary in the Contragate affair, and a friend of Rob Lowe since her celebrity came through. Her peremptory epistle reads: "I'm Fawn Hall. I'd like to meet you." Springsteen writes back: "I don't like you, I don't like your boss, I don't like what you did. Thank you."

May 2: Springsteen's parents Douglas and Adele, who moved from Freehold, N.J., to the San Francisco area when he was 17, attend both shows at the Shoreline Amphitheater near Palo Alto. The first night he dedicates 'Walk Like A Man" from Tunnel Of Love to his father with a quiet "This one's for you, pops" and sings it, hair-raisingly, straight at him.

That same day, Peter Gabriel has flown into San Francisco intent on persuading Springsteen to join the putative Amnesty International all-star world tour he's been hatching for a year with Al America's Executive Director Jack Healey. He watches the set, then goes backstage. Not a pushy sort, he doesn't get all the way through the security net, but finds himself on the band bus, spots Landau, plonks down beside him and pitches as hard as natural reticence and politeness will permit throughout the hour's drive back to the hotel. At the end of it, he's not sure whether he's made any impression.

May 3: Second show at the Shoreline and tonight's favoured female invited up for the statutory spot of on stage frugging during 'Dancing In The Dark' is none other than Bruce's mum. As they boogaloo through the middle eight, Bruce confides, "I learnt all my moves from my ma." This is no great surprise to connoisseurs of Springsteen-style rug-cutting.

May 16: Wizened TV sex therapist Dr Ruth gets backstage at the first of five Madison Square Garden concerts and tells Bruce, "I like what you say about love and sex, but there's one more thing you need to include in your show --- contraception." His response: "Gee, it's gonna be tough to get the word contraception into a song."

May 19: Amnesty's Jack Healey spends the afternoon at MSG discussing the practicalities of the AI tour with Landau and Springsteen's booking agent Frank Barsalona. He's asked to talk to the artist alone after the show. He says, "I go into this long room and there's Bruce, very tired with a terry cloth on him and he just said, tell me about human rights. So I blithered on for 50 minutes, giving it my best shot. He just stared the whole time and didn't say a word apart from two questions: one was about American Indians and the other was about refugees. At the end he said, Well, what can I do? I swallowed hard and said, You have to do the whole tour. He just said, OK, whatever it takes. I'll be there. I was overcome and, being Irish, I leapt on him, hugged him and he started crying."

May 23: Last night of the 37-date American tour.

May 26: The London tabloids are preparing a welcome for him. The Sun carries the first report, based on quotes from a New York barman who claims to have served Springsteen several beers, that Bruce and Julianne have split up "because she wouldn't give him a baby".

June 2: The Sun reports Springsteen spotted on "a bender" with Bono in Los Angeles following a stressful "heart to heart" with Julianne.

June 11: The European tour --- significantly, stadium-based --- opens at the Stadio Communale, Turin.

June 13: At 3am in Rome Springsteen strolls into the Piaza Di Spagna with Patti Scialfa, Jersey Girl, E Street backing singer and, of late, rhythm guitarist. The place is deserted apart from a few hippies on the Spanish Steps still sharing a cosmic thought or two. Bruce asks if he might borrow a guitar and delivers himself of a fervent 'I'm On Fire' and a moody 'The River', then wanders on.

June 15: With Springsteen playing in Rome still, but due in England the following week, The Sun caps all the gossip with an "Exclusive" boasting "The pictures that will cost The Boss £75 million" (that is, half Springsteen's estimated wealth should said snaps lead to Julianne divorcing him). The telephoto snaps in question are blurred, yet unmistakably show Springsteen standing on a Rome hotel balcony with Patti Scialfa and kissing her on a poolside lounger. His management refuse, and will continue to refuse, any comment about his marriage.

June 20: The Sun greets his arrival in England with a story, billed as a "Sun World Exclusive", but actually rehashing the year-old lawsuit by roadies Batlin and Sutphin, which has begun to wend its way through the American courts. For the remainder of his week-long stay the tabloids are aflutter and agog with the saga of his marriage. "Friends" of Julianne are now allegedly leaking quotes about it being all over because of the Rome pictures "flaunting" his relationship with Patti.

The Daily Express claims to have talked with Patti, who allegedly enlightens them with the following insightful quote: "Bruce is great. He's the Boss!"

July 3: Part of the second Stockholm show is broadcast live to 20 countries.

Springsteen uses the occasion to announce the Amnesty Human Rights Now! tour.

And somehow Britt Ekland gets on stage as a backing singer during his 'You Can Look' routine.

July 10: With Springsteen back in England to play two dates in Sheffield, The People reports that Julianne refuses to comment on claims that, in the absence of the standard superstar "prenuptial agreement" limiting the wife's claims in the event of a marriage breakdown, she is asking £18 million for a "quickie" divorce. Other sums mentioned in the ensuing months are a £20 million lump sum plus £3,000 a week, £15/£12/ £6-1/2 and £3 million. At the same time, Springsteen's "fortune" is stated to be worth anything from £20 to £300 million. Whatever the deal, it is always assumed to be attached to a binding promise of no "kiss-and-tell" book to follow. Julianne has also landed a couple of promising movie roles, one with Chevy Chase in Fletch Lives.

July 19: About 150,000 assemble at Weissensee cycling track in East Berlin for a concert arranged two weeks' notice after Springsteen's management told the city authorities he would like to play there. The show is slotted in as a more than auspicious start to a previously arranged Nicaragua solidarity festival, with proceeds going to the Karl Marx Hospital, Managua.

East German radio broadcasts two hours of the show later that night and the unreconstructed old guard are paying attention. When Springsteen introduces Dylan's 'Chimes Of Freedom' by saying in German, "I am not here today in support of, or opposition to, any government. I'm here to play some rock 'n" roll music for East Berliners in the hope that someday all the barriers between us will be torn down", the second sentence is cut.

July 23: An hour after Springsteen arrives in Copenhagen, he goes out for an afternoon amble near his hotel and passes a young busker, one John Magnusson, who is regaling an audience of two with his version of 'The River'. Magnusson stops, gapes, then calls out, "Hey Bruce!" Springsteens comes over, borrows his guitar, duets 'The River' with him, then piles into 'I'm On Fire' and 'Dancing In The Dark'. As the crowd grows, Springsteen hugs Magnusson and strides briskly away. A tourist catches the scene on his camcorder and flogs it to Danish TV.

August 3: The European tour closes at the Nou Camp football stadium in Barcelona.

August 21: Springsteen drops into The Stone Pony, has a few beers, sits in for a couple of numbers with house band Cats On A Smooth Surface.

September 1: As the Human Rights Now! tour is launched in London, the morning papers report that Julianne is filing for divorce after she and Bruce "burnt up the telephone lines trying to hash out our future".

With the other artists, Springsteen undergoes his first press conference. He has his Amnesty position prepared --- "Rock'n'roll can offer a transcendent moment of freedom" --- but he refuses to answer questions about his marriage.

September 2: Closing the Wembley concert, Springsteen presents 15 songs (including the E Street Band backing the entire company on 'Chimes Of Freedom') which reflect his return to 'Born In The USA' and other stadium- friendly material on the European tour. This, incidentally, thrusts The Big Man, sax legend Clarence Clemons, centrestage (to his obvious joy) while relegating Patti Scialfa to the backline.

September 10: Before the Barcelona concert Springsteen talks to Amnesty's tour reporter. He says, "My band's happier than they've been in years, but one of the reasons I wanted to do this was because I wanted to work with other artists. I haven't toured with any other bands since I was 24. I wanted to work in a collective of some sort. I wanted to get in with a bunch of people who had an idea and subsume my identity into that idea, into that collective, and try to come out with something that's more meaningful and bigger and better than I could do on my own."

September 15: When Sting comes on to duet 'The River', Springsteen, who first met him less than a month before, describes him as "my best friend, a man of bizarre sexual perversity". Then, for 'Dancing In The Dark' he hauls a man up onstage to boogie with him. Bruce-watchers ruminate gloomily about the number of earrings he's wearing these days (about six).

September 18: In Philadelphia, Springsteen is asked whether the artists are educating one another about the politics of the countries they visit. He says: "Well, Sting once said he knew the answer to every question. In fact, between sets he tutors me on what's wrong with my music."

September 30: Learning that the New Delhi concert has been presented by sponsoring newspaper The Times Of India as, primarily, a celebration of their 150th anniversary, Springsteen tells the journalists, "We didn't come all this way for a birthday party!"

October 7: In Harare, Zimbabwe, fans spot Springsteen in a record shop buying cassettes of a dozen African albums.

Introducing Edwin Starr's 'War', he addresses the estimated 15,000 white South Africans in the crowd, comparing conscription into their army with conscription into the Vietnam War, and concludes, "There can be no peace without justice and where there is apartheid --- systematic as in your country or economic as in mine --- there is no justice, there is only war."

October 8: Flying into Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Springsteen is still full of last night's show: "Unfortunately, most of the audiences I draw in the US are white. In Harare I had my first chance to play to an integrated audience.

Looking out and seeing black hands raised with white hands was a very emotional moment for me."

October 15: Human Rights Now! concludes in Buenos Aires, having flown 35,000 miles to play to a million people. Because of technical difficulties, a seven- hour live worldwide radio broadcast includes only 100 minutes of music (less than half Springsteen's set) and is padded with interviews and ads for tour sponsor Reebok and Trojan condoms.

Springsteen tells the final press conference, "This tour was about trying to assert myself as a world citizen. As a boy all I knew of Africa and India and South America was what I studied in geography class. And I wasn't a very good student. The end of this tour marks my graduation of sorts. And I hope that I'll be able to go back to home and, in my music, write about a different sensibility that I felt. And I hope to get American young people out of their shell."

November 26: In San Francisco to visit his parents for Thanksgiving, Springsteen pays a small hours visit to the Stone club and joins Southside Johnny & the Jukes, now resident in California, onstage for the first time since 1982 --- 'In The Midnight Hour', 'Little Queenie' and so on.

December: The year closes with gossip rife and Springsteen lying low after probably the hardest year of his life. The first stage of the divorce is said to have been completed, the decree absolute to follow in March. The Sun avers that the relationship with "gorgeous girlfriend Patti, 22" (going on 36, that is) is supposed to be over because she's looked for a pay rise. Robert Stigwood claims to be offering him £10 million to play Che, opposite Meryl Streep, in the movie of Rice-Lloyd Webbers Evita.

1989

January: Springsteen is seen in a Los Angeles studio, possibly working on Patti Scialfa's planned solo album but also recording demos for himself, they say. The Bruce Watch dream of an autumn release.

January 18: At the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, as ever, he sings 'Crying' in tribute to Roy Orbison, who died just before Christmas, then jams with Jagger and Richards, plus Patti, original E Street drummer "Mad Dog" Lopez, and George Theiss, a member of his first band the Castiles, founded in 1965.

March: The roadies' case inches forward. A New Jersey judge refuses Batlin and Sutphin's damages claim for "emotional distress" but says their case on unpaid overtime has to be answered.

March 10: After an early evening party for former world champion boxer Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini, Springsteen moves on to Rubber, an L.A. club owned by Mickey Rourke. He plays 'CC Rider' with local bar band the Mighty Hornets.

Meanwhile, the tabloids have Bruce and Patti about to marry, with Rourke as best man.

April: While sporadic studio activity continues in California, Springsteen's management take on the Parents' Music Resource Centre, the campaigners who have caused many American records to be stickered with warnings about their unsuitability for youthful consumption. They have released a video quoting Springsteen as saying, supportively, "In many ways what's happening in music today is very corrupting. Let's help our children toss out the garbage".

They say they read the quote in Reader's Digest. The Digest say they took it from Rolling Stone. But they're wrong. It didn't exist. Reader's Digest apologises. PMRC re-edit their video.

June 2: Max Weinberg asks Springsteen to play with his jumpin' jive-style big band Killer Joe to support the annual Jersey Shore Jazz & Blues Festival at the Stone Pony. It's part of an effort to revive the local music scene --- the Asbury Park Rock'n'Roll Museum and Palace Amusements, home of the original "Tunnel Of Love", have recently closed and the Pony itself is under threat from municipal redevelopment. They blast through to the early morning, ably assisted by Patti and E Street keyboardist Roy Bittan.

Nobody is aware of it, but this is the start of what becomes known as The Summer Club Tour '89. For three months Springsteen is everywhere, "guesting"

20 times. He'll not only sit in with the band of the night, but hang out for as long as socially feasible, quaffing his share of Heinekens and the occasional "kamikaze" vodka cocktail.

June 20: After jamming with Nils Lofgren's band at the Stone Pony, Neil Young on Long Island, and singing Elvis's 'Loving You' at a friend's wedding over the previous couple of weeks, Springsteen takes a neighbour down to Martell's at Point Pleasant because Bobby Bandiera's on. Bandiera plays Kansas City and Bruce is up there.

However, Martell's management can't resist running an ad in the local paper "thanking" him for dropping in --- and that's the last they ever see of him.

July 2: At the Cafe Bar, Long Branch, NJ --- a township where he inhabited a scuzzy apartment in his late teens ---it's Springsteen's fourth night out on the trot following guest spots with school fête mates the Fabulous Greaseband at the Headliner in Neptune, Jackson Browne in the unlikely setting of an Atlantic City casino, and former Miami Horn La Bamba at the Pony. This one's an offputting affair, though, because when he joins Gary 'US' Bonds, a man whose career he had resurrected in the early '80s, the audience gets over enthusiastic. After a rousing New Orleans, a speaker stack collapses and Springsteen does a runner for the safety of one and all.

July 22: Jamming 'Twist And Shout' and 'Gloria' with local combo Peter Hartung & the Remake at the Rumrunner, the nearest hostelry to his Rumson home, Bruce peers at the somewhat yuppified Lacoste-clad clientele and bawls, "I'm gonna rock the crocs right offa your shirts!"

July 23: Bruce in excelsis at the Pony. He dances all night with Patti and anyone else who'll shake a leg with him, then grabs the vocal mike from Cats On A Smooth Surface and finishes 'Old Time Rock'n'Roll' from the floor before taking the stage for an extended set of golden oldies.

August 11: At the Garden State Arts Centre at Holmdel (the town where Bruce recorded Nebraska in a day) Ringo's All Starr Band, which sports Clarence Clemons and Nils Lofgren as regulars, are joined by Weinberg, Bittan and Springsteen for 'Get Back', 'Long Tall Sally', 'Photograph' and 'With A Little Help From Friends'.

August 16: Back for a second night at the microscopic Cheers bar in Long Branch, Springsteen plays a longish set with Bandiera, but he looks so preoccupied the audience wonder why he's bothering. The long, hot summer seems to have run its course.

September 13-14: He records 'Viva Las Vegas' for The Last Temptation Of Elvis, a Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy benefit album organised by Roy Carr of NME, at One On One Studio, North Hollywood. He's backed by former Face Ian McLagan (keyboards) and session stars Bob Glaub (bass) and Jeff Porcaro (drums).

September 23: Over in New Jersey again, a comprehensively-bombed Bruce celebrates his 40 the birthday at the Rumrunner with the E Street Band and Little Steven too. His parents are over from the West Coast. He dances with his mother, his Uncle Warren features on back-up vocals and nobody at the time gives a thought to the possibility that this maybe the E Street Band's last gig. When he stumbles into Glory Days, Springsteen declares: "I dedicate this song to to me! I may be 40 years old but, dammit, I'm still handsome."

September 29: Prescott, Arizona --- a small township between Flagstaff and Phoenix --- has one of its less predictable days. About lunchtime four bikers, followed by a mobile home, pull up at a diner and order some Cokes. The odd thing is that one of them is a stubbly, heavy-jowled Bruce Springsteen. After a while he asks where he might find "some biker girls" and is directed to Matt's Saloon on Whiskey Row.

He walks over and strikes up a conversation with the extensively-tattooed --- in fact, just extensive --- barmaid Brenda "Bubbles" Pechanec, lately hitched for the eighth time as he soon learns. Naturally, there's a house band... he joins them in trashing 'Don't Be Cruel', 'Route 66' and 'I'm On Fire'. "I'm here in Prescott to take Bubbles away and be her ninth!" he boilers, then cries off a request for 'Pink Cadillac' on the grounds that he's forgotten the words.

In due course, most of Prescott is making for Matt's. The little saloon starts to implode. Springsteen clambers over the bar, then steps smartly out the back way, mounts his silver and blue Harley Davidson and speeds off down Highway 89 with mates/minders in his wake.

A few weeks later Bubbles has tangible proof that it wasn't a dream or an impostor. She's suffering from stomach cancer and has impossible medical bills of around $100,000. Springsteen office calls and asks for details. Soon the hospital turns a small cheque she has sent, explaining that her account has been settled in full.

November 13: US magazines People and Newsweek print a story leaked from somewhere in the Springsteen organisation that the E Street Band have been told their services are no longer required. It's been talked about before, but now it's true, at least for the time being. Bruce has rung each of them to say they should "feel free to accept other offers".

In the usual absence of anything illuminating from Jon Landau's office, E Streeters are pursued for their reactions. Mostly, discretion rules. Lofgren says: "Right now Bruce is just a little... he's searching. He's allowed to be confused."

But Clemons is less guarded: "That phone call made me go from being very shocked, to being angry, to happy, all in about ten seconds. Now I'm over it, though. I've been constantly in a shadow. I wasn't playing what I wanted to hear. My diminishing role in his music had me crazy. He was getting away from that sound, from the saxophone."

Regardless, every member of the band --- apart from the enigmatic "Phantom"

Danny Federici, the other keyboard player --- is engaged in other enterprises anyway, though with diverse levels of success: Clemons and Lofgren have their own solo careers, neither prospering currently; Roy Bittan is a session star; bassman Garry Tallent is re-established in Nashville as a producer; Weinberg has a fun band, a sideline as a rock'n'roller on the lecture circuit, has just completed a degree in communications and is starting a law course.

December 17: Clarence and his Red Bank Rockers play a small theatre in Ventura, California, and suddenly they're a hot ticket --- Jackson Browne, Daryl Hannah and Springsteen, wintering in the West again, form a queue to sit in.

Between 'Glory Days' and 'Cadillac Ranch', Clemons plays a doubtless pointed instrumental called 'Forgiveness'.

January 15: It's officially announced that Patti is pregnant and the couple "overjoyed".

January 17: Springsteen, hair grown long and occasionally tied back in a pony tail, faithfully turns out for the Hall Of Fame bash. He and Patti share a table with Sting. Bruce plays with former Creedence Clearwater leader John Fogerty, then takes a hand in the all-star massacre of 'Long Tall Sally', his favourite bar jam of '89.

February: He works for two weeks in Studio City in L.A., with drummer Steve Jordan and bass Randy Jackson, session aristocrats. Among 15 tracks supposedly recorded, one title breaks the surface, 'Just Another Roll Of The Dice', but nobody's claiming to have heard so much as a bar of it. Little Steven's bandanas are often to be seen hung out to dry on a balcony at L.A.'S best known rock'n'roll hotel, the Sunset Marquis --- he's thought to be in there pitching on production.

February 12: Springsteen joins Sting's "most expensive garage band in the world" at a high price benefit for his (since rather discredited) rainforest charity. With Paul Simon, Don Henley and Jackson Browne, they take turns in offering a greatest hit or two to 900 Hollywood glitterati assembled in a tent in the grounds of movie producer Ted Fields' house. With tickets at £1,000-£50,000, depending on corporate status, more than a million is raised.

Then the rock'n'rollers repair to a gig called the China Club and do it all again. By chance, Joe Walsh is there and insists on a Rocky Mountain Way workout.

March: Roy Bittan is around, and Sting is reported to be involved in the studio, perhaps co-writing with Springsteen. But the Bruce Watch are not convinced. His collaborations rarely see the light of day (even the tracks he is believed to have recorded with his beloved Orbison late in '88 remained under wraps).

March 1: At the Inglewood Forum, California, Tom Petty introduces his old sparring partner Bob Dylan who does 'Rainy Day Women'. Then Springsteen joins them for a couple of songs before he and Dylan withdraw arm in arm.

April: Album rumours pick up speed. The lyrics are overtly political. David Sancious' mum bumps into a Bruce Watcher on the Shore and says her boy, an early E Streeter, is recording with Springsteen after they met again on the Amnesty tour when Sancious played keyboards for Peter Gabriel. Little Feat piano man Bill Payne is another name widely canvassed.

Bruce and Patti are guests at producer Chuck Plotkin's wedding (Springsteen duets with Tom Waits on his song 'Jersey Girl', the cover version of which closes the Live box), and then at a special showing of Born On The Fourth Of July, to which they have been invited by Ron Kovic, author of the original book and the real-life character Tom Cruise played. Springsteen has often talked about Kovic when introducing 'Born In The USA' and they have become friends.

April 30: In London, the Mirror claims Springsteen has bought a £10 million estate in West L.A. with two large houses, a lot of 200-foot tall eucalyptus trees, and no pool or tennis court.

May: The latest hearing in the readies case rules that Springsteen's tax records are not to be placed "in the public domain" as Batlin and Sutphin's lawyers have requested. Now, in addition to the unpaid overtime question, they claim that a promise to keep their pay "just behind the musicians'" was not honoured. Springsteen's lawyers say the two were paid $225,000 in ex gratia severance when they left his employ in 1985.

June: Springsteen gives hardline rap group 2 Live Crew permission to sample 'Born In The USA' for their single 'Banned In The USA', a protest against the way they are being censored at the behest of people like the PMRC.

August: Baby due at press time. Album due in October? Tour due next year...?
