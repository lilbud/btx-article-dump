In the mid-60's a little known Jersey Shore band called the Motifs was packing venus, until their young frontman was sent to Vietnam.

Growing up, David and Bryan Cichon had heard many stories about their Dad.

Mostly it was their Mom, Carolee, who told them. But sometimes other family members and friends would reminisce as well. They'd talk about this band, The Motifs. Their Dad, Walter Cichon, was the band's lead singer.

"They told us how popular they were", said David Cichon, now 47, who lives in Morris Plains. "My mom used to say if he hadn't gone to Vietnam, he would have been as big as Bruce." Bruce Springsteen, that is.

That sounded so preposterous that the brothers just had to laugh. "We took it all with a grain of salt", David Cichon said.

Then, nearly 10 years ago, the two brothers heard "The Wall", a searing ballad about a deceased Marine whose friend visits the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., searching for his name on the black wall.

"Cigarettes and a bottle of beer, this poem that I wrote for you; This black stone and these hard tears are all I got left now of you", Springsteen had written. "Your high boots and striped t-shirt, ah, Billy you looked so bad; Yeah you and your rock and roll band, you were the best thing this --- town ever had."

Before performing the song in concert, Springsteen had spoken of Walter Cichon, talked about how the song was inspired by him.

"It kind of just blew us away", Cichon said. "After we heard that song, my brother and I both tried to reach out to him." It took awhile, but in 2008, Springsteen invited the Cichon boys to his concert in Orlando. Bryan Cichon lives in Jacksonville, and David flew down to meet him and attend the concert.

Afterward, the brothers met Bruce.

"It was just basically him reminiscing about those days", David Cichon said.

"He said to us, 'Your father was one of the best frontman I ever saw.' This coming from one of the very best frontmen there is, it was just amazing."

They thanked him for writing the song. "We need to get that on an album one day", Springsteen said.

The Cichon boys didn't know if he was serious, but they left their meeting with Springsteen believing that their father had star power after all.

'Ahead of his time"

Back in the summer of 1967, almost everyone knew it.

The Motifs --- from Western Monmouth County --- were the hottest band on the Jersey Shore, and dreamed of making it big in the music business. And why not?

They had worked every weekend, had a local hit song, and had a reputation as the "bad boys" of the music scene, with their shaggy hair and their raw sensual swagger on stage.

And they had Walter Cichon, a lead singer from Howell who wore tight black pants and pointy-toe boots, and grew his dark hair dangerously long. Quiet and soft-spoken offstage, Cichon, who would turn 21 late that summer, was working as a printer's apprentice, hoping to learn the printing trade to support his young family. Wickedly intelligent, with an IQ of 163, Cichon, so polite and unassuming offstage, turned into a dynamo when he grabbed a microphone.

The teenagers who packed The Motifs' shows --- at venues like the I.B. Club in Howell or Long Branch's West End Casino --- pushed up to the stage to get closer when Walter started to sing.

"He was lean, muscular, with a chiseled face", said "Stormin" Norman Seldin, 67, who was only 17 when he began managing the band. "When he got onstage he would instantly sweat. His hair would be drenched and it would hang down. You can't make what he had. He was just dynamic. He was special."

Planting his feet on stage, his dark hair dripping sweat, Cichon would pound a tambourine, bang a cowbell, or shake maracas as he sang. Slightly menacing and a little bit wild, he was unlike any other frontman on the scene. And his songs, "Molly", and "If I Gave You Love", were raw and deeply personal, with bits of The Kinks, The Animals and The Rolling Stones mixed in.

"Molly", produced by Seldin and released on his Selsom Record label, sold 2,000 copies and drew praise from WMCA disc jockey Joe O'Brien, who said The Motifs "have a new, original sound, that is strictly their own."

Springsteen dubbed Cichon "the best front man in New Jersey at the time", in a 1999 interview he gave to Mojo magazine.

"He was ahead of his time", said Cichon's band-mate and best friend, Murray Bauer, who now lives in Cherry Hill. "The songs he wrote, they were really coming from inside him. They were very personal." Bauer and his girlfriend, and Walter and Carolee, who would become his wife, would double-date all the time. He and Walter would finish each other's sentences. They did everything together.

Seldin, a teenage music entrepreneur, had met The Motifs after the band called his father's Red Bank jewelry store and asked if Norman would be interested in managing them. Seldin at the time was managing and recording six different rhythm and blues bands from Asbury Park and Long Branch. He had already brought bands like The Duprees and The Coasters to the Shore. The Motifs wanted to meet him.

They came to Seldin's parents' house in Fair Haven for an audition, and set up their amps in the living room. The first song they played was The Kinks' "You Really Got Me." He didn't know what to make of them. They were loud and raucous and raw. They didn't sound like the R&B groups, or anyone else he had heard.

"My mother convinced me to give them a chance", Seldin said. He took them in the studio and produced their single. From there, the band took off quickly.

Hottest band on the Shore

They played the West End Casino in Long Branch and more than 800 kids paid $2 each to see them. "We must have sold 200 records that night", Seldin remembered.

They began opening for bigger bands at shows Seldin produced at the Keyport- Matawan Rollerdome, including The Duprees and The Young Rascals.

The Motifs could earn $125 or more for gigs, at a time when Springsteen's first major band, "The Castiles", took home $75 a show. The teenage Springsteen, often accompanied by his Castiles' bandmate, George Theiss, would frequently go to Motifs' shows and sometimes aggravated the group's young female fans by angling their way closer to the stage so that Bruce could study Walter up close.

Walter's brother, Raymond, the group's lead guitar player, showed the young Springsteen some guitar riffs when Bruce would come over to the Cichons' house in Howell. Bruce liked the homemade pierogies that Helen Cichon, Walter's mom, made for the boys. He also liked watching The Motifs practice and discussing guitar techniques with Ray.

"He said we were the first rock stars he ever met", said John Lewandoski, The Motifs' drummer, "but he could approach us, because we were all friends. We would be practicing and Bruce would come over. He said Ray was the best guitar player on the Shore."

Walter's younger sister, Anna Vance, remembers going to see the band at the I.B. Club, and watching the teenagers throng toward the stage. The band even made a television appearance, she said, performing on Jerry Lewis' Muscular Dystrophy Telethon very early in the morning in 1967.

"I remember my Mom getting me up to watch it on TV", said Vance, who lives in Toms River. "There were on at five o'clock in the morning, some oddball hour."

The band's future seemed bright. But then, in the fall of 1967, Walter Cichon was drafted. He joined Company A, 3rd Battalion of the Army's 8th Infantry.

The Vietnam War was raging. Walter had a wife, Carolee, and two very young sons. But, having completed his training, Staff Sgt. Cichon volunteered to go to Vietnam.

"He really didn't want to go into the service", said Bauer, the band's rhythm guitarist, who was drafted the same day as his best friend. "He'd say, 'Now that we're doing so good, I'm going to get drafted.' But once he was in the service, he was like an All-American, he gave it 100 percent."

"He felt the kids going over there were so young", Cichon's late mother, Helen, said In a 1999 interview with the Asbury Park Press. "He was a little older, and he thought maybe he could help the younger soldiers."

Cichon was 21 when he went to Vietnam. On March 30, 1968, in Kantom, then- South Vietnam, witnesses said he emerged from a trench with a hand grenade and was shot in the head. An Army buddy told his mother that he held Walter in his arms until the rest of the unit was forced to retreat under heavy enemy fire.

Walter and about 10 other dead or wounded soldiers were left behind. His body was never recovered, and he was declared missing in action. His oldest boy, Gordon Bryan, was almost two; his second son, David, was 11 months old. The boys were split up. Bryan was raised by their grandparents and David stayed with Carolee. They would never get to know their father, who received two Purple Hearts, one with an Oak Leaf Cluster.

In July 1975, the Army paid for his funeral. A white memorial marker was placed at Evergreen Cemetery in Farmingdale.

'It was never the same"

"I just pretty much gave up my music altogether after he died", Bauer said.

Seldin agreed. "I really thought he would come back because he was such a survivor", he said. "After that, it wasn't the same. Before, it was raw and it was honest.. Where are you going to get that again?"

Walter's father, the senior Walter Cichon, died in 1969, a year to the day after his son's death. Helen Cichon, who passed away in 1999, said in an interview with the Press that her husband "went a little crazy after Walter died. He was drinking so heavily. He never really recovered from it."

The family was to experience even more tragedy. In 1980, his brother, Raymond Cichon, who had become a salesman for a Freehold food service, died suddenly at his mother's house, several days after telling her and other friends that he had been beaten up. No charges were ever brought in the case.

The Motifs continued on after Cichon and Bauer were drafted, but they were a different, lesser band. "All the originality was gone after Walter left"Motifs' drummer John Lewandoski said. "We became more of a club band."

Personnel came and went, times changed, and the band finally fell apart by the late 1970s, after briefly going through a disco phase. Bass player Vinnie Roslin had left much earlier, to join Springsteen in his band, Child, which became Steel Mill, the Boss' most popular pre-E Street Band. Roslin passed away in 2012.

Seldin still performs regularly in the Shore area, playing piano and singing his original songs, as well as some cover tunes. In 2008, he released a two-cd set of music he'd produced, "Asbury Park Then and Now", which included The Motifs' two songs among its 45 tracks.

Walter's wife, Carolee, remarried and had two more children. She was 59 when she died in 2007.

Springsteen, of course, went on to become a rock and roll icon. Although many on the Shore may have forgotten about Walter Cichon, Bruce Springsteen never did.

The title of the song "The Wall" and its inspiration came from Springsteen's long-time friend and sometimes songwriting partner Joe Grushecky, but the song was not written until after Springsteen and his wife, Patti Scialfa, paid a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. While there, they had looked up Walter Cichon's name, Springsteen later said.

Springsteen first performed the song in 2003, and then again in 2005. But he did not release it until this year, when it was included on his eighteenth studio album, "High Hopes."

If there was ever any doubt that the song was about Walter Cichon, Springsteen erased it in his liner notes for the album, along with a longer piece about The Motifs' frontman that appeared on his official website. He described The Motifs as "a local rock band that was always a head above everybody else. Raw, sexy and rebellious, they were the heroes you aspired to be."

"He still performs somewhat regularly in my mind, the way he stood, dressed, held the tambourine, the casual cool, the freeness", Springsteen wrote. "The man who by his attitude, his walk said 'you can defy all this, all of what's here, all of what you've been taught, taught to fear, to love and you'll still be alright.' His was a terrible loss to us, his loved ones and the local music scene. I still miss him."

His bandmates do, too.

"When I think about what could have been, it blows me away sometimes", said Lewandoski, 68, who lives just south of Allentown, Pa., and is retired after a career as a sales manager in the food business.

Bauer, 67, is also retired, after 42 years in real estate. "I think about it myself sometimes. If Walter hadn't died"," his voice trailed off. "It would have been a whole different life."

Springsteen dubbed Cichon "the best front man in New Jersey at the time."
