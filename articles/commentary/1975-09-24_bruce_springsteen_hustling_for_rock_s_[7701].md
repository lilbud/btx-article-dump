HE STARTED HIS career as a solo performer and fronting New Jersey bar bands like the Steel Mill and Dr. Zoom and the Sonic Boom.

Signed to Columbia by John Hammond in 1972, his first album Greetings From Asbury Park, N. J. sent critics scurrying for superlatives; he was hailed as another new Dylan for his physical appearance, off-the-wall lyrics and imposing array of colorfully-named street characters. The chorus of acclaim grew to a roar with the release of The Wild, The Innocent And the E Street Shuffle, a 1974 Rolling Stone Record of the year; comments placing the future of rock'n'roll on his shoulders began to appear and Jon Landau quit his job at Rolling Stone to help produce Born to Run.

He took the E street Band to the alien turf of Texas to play his brand of R&B-flavored punk rock drawn from the streets of Jersey and the sidewalks of New York to an audience unfamiliar with his work - and received a standing ovation after the song. At Carnegie Hall he closed a song with the line "Uptown in Harlem she throws a rose to some lucky young matador" - and as the last notes faded away, a young girl in the audience silently stood up and threw a single red rose past his ear.

Bruce Springsteen is a 25-year old romantic whose feet are firmly cemented in urban concrete, whose heart and mind are directly attuned to the hopes and fears of the young American male. An adventurous spirit musically, his albums range from the acoustic-dominated Asbury to the Latin-tinged electric eclecticism of E Street and the arranged precision of the new album. Born to Run is a virtual primer on the music of the mid-'60s filtered through the experiences of the '70s. Springsteen has been ably abetted throughout by the potent E Street Band, a unit who may well be everything you always wanted in a rock band but were afraid to ask for.

The power and versatility of the band perfectly complements Springsteen's throaty singing. He is a vocal actor, utilizing techniques ranging from a hoarse stage whisper to soulful falsetto whoops to maximize the dramatic impact of his songs. The key to his vocal effectiveness is his sense of timing, an instinctive grasp of what to do when and for how long.

When his vocal delivery and lyrics mesh, Springsteen is capable of creating a compelling persona through vivid imagery drawn from a myriad of sources.

Springsteen's lyrics are drawn from the classic themes or rock'n'roll - young love, cars, the celebration of youth and the strains of growing up, the dream of hitting it big - but with a rare combination of intelligence and emotional intensity. His songs, highly romanticized depictions of nighttime street life - often cinematic in their scope and attention to detail - are populated by people like the Magic Rat, Crazy Janey, Spanish Johnny, and Sloppy Sue and Big Balls Billy.

The emotions are extreme, undercut by the desperation and impatience of youth and sobering sense of mortality and dashed hopes. He wants to know if life is real, to place his faith in the magical spirits of the night and find one of his dreams, to die on the streets in an everlasting kiss, to run from the stifling atmosphere of his town. The women in Springsteen's life can have hearts of gold ('The E Street Shuffle' and 'Incident on 57th Street') or stone ('She's The One'); many of his greatest songs are those where he must persuade a reluctant woman to come with him by painting a vision of excitement and romance in the night ('Rosalita', 'Thunder Road' and 'Born to Run').

Throughout his writing, characters must share the spotlight with hemi-powered drones - Springsteen's obsession with cars rivals those of Chuck Berry and the hot-rodding Beach Boys. Automotive imagery abounds; cars are vehicles of release from the confining drudgery of the nine-to-five world, from the suicide-trap towns full of losers.

Bruce Springsteen is just a prisoner of his dreams, honest and aware enough to accurately depict the dilemmas facing someone growing up in these times, sensitive enough to capture their emotional quandaries in attempting to deal with them. He is the embodiment of the rock traditions of the late '50s and early mid-'60s - his genius lies in his ability to synthesize those familiar elements into a compelling. It works because Springsteen has lived and sings of experiences and fantasies common to all: joining the circus, hanging out in amusement parks and pinball arcades, cruising in the summer looking for love, skipping school and acting cool, staying out all night. The effect is galvanizing on vinyl; live, with the E Street Band playing like a jungle fire behind him, Springsteen's impact is riveting. If rock'n'roll has ever struck a responsive chord in your soul, this man will affect you.

He'll be at the Roxy Oct. 16-19 - don't expect the tickets to last long once they go on sale.
