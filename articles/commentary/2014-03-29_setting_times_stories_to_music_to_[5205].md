While editing my current story, I listened to my Spotify playlist of the bleaker songs on Bruce Springsteen's "The River." (Yes, I created a playlist of grim Springsteen. Is that odd?)

It's always seemed like a schizophrenic record, perhaps because it's a slightly bloated two-album release. Half of the songs are your classic E Street rockers like "Sherry Darling" and "Crush on You", the kind of songs Springsteen fills with "little darlins."

I prefer the other half, some of the darkest of his career: "Point Blank""Fade Away", "Stolen Car", "The Price You Pay", "Drive All Night", "Wreck on the Highway" and, finally, one of his best songs, "The River." (Is a dream a lie if it don't come true/Or is it something worse?)
