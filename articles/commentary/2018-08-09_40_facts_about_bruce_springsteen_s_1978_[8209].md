CLEVELAND, Ohio -- If you know anything about local music or rock history in general, you've certainly heard of, if not listened to the most famous concert in Cleveland history.

It took place on Aug. 9, 1978 at the Agora where Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band delivered what many fans consider their greatest performance.

What made the show legendary is that it was broadcast live by WMMS. That broadcast became one of the most popular bootlegs in music history.

In honor of the show's 40th anniversary, Cleveland-based oWOW internet radio will play one track on the hour every hour on Thursday. The station is run by former WMMS program director John Gorman.

Here's a look back at 40 facts about that legendary night.

The show marked WMMS' first simulcast of an entire concert.

WMMS sponsored the concert as part of the radio station's 10th anniversary.

The concert was announced less than two weeks beforehand.

The concert took place in front of a capacity crowd.

Oh, admission was free.

WMMS drew postcards dropped off by listeners in order to giveaway tickets.

Fans slept on the sidewalk the night before the general admission show.

The concert was originally supposed to take place in a bigger market like Chicago or Detroit, but WMMS was able to convince Springsteen's label it would be a marquee event in a city like Cleveland.

Springsteen first played the Agora in front of a half-full audience in 1974.

WMMS music director Kid Leo emceed the show. He was close friends with Springsteen.

Kid Leo's signature intro for the show: "Ladies and gentlemen, the main event. Round for round, pound for pound, there ain't no finer band around, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band!"

WMMS wasn't the only station to broadcast the show. Seven other stations also showcased the concert on their channels.

Those other stations were located in Pittsburgh, Chicago, Columbus, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, Detroit and St. Louis.

The live broadcast reached an estimated 3 million listeners.

The Agora concert was later given to radio station KSAN in San Francisco to air as a replacement for a cancelled Springsteen concert later that year.

Springsteen's famed manager Jon Landau and producer Jimmy Iovine were in charge of the recording and mixing of the concert.

Given the radio broadcast aspect, the show started on time.

Likely to prevent background noise, beverages were not served during the show.

The sound quality of the show was deemed so good, organizers assumed the likelihood it would be bootlegged before it could be turned into a proper live album.

Thus, Columbia Records never released a live recording, due mainly to the bootlegs.

Before it was officially released, restored and remastered in 2014, the Agora radio broadcast one of the most widely circulated concert bootlegs in history.

The Agora show was the second live album release as part of the "Bruce Springsteen Archives." The first was his 2012 performance at the Apollo Theater in New York City.

Concert archivist Toby Scott, responsible for the "Springsteen Archives" found the original Agora tape reels in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's "Asbury Park to the Promised Land" exhibit.

Rolling Stone critic Rob Sheffield gave the official 2014 release five stars.

The Agora show featured two sets and multiple encores. The show opened with a cover of Eddie Cochran's "Summertime Blues."

In the middle of performing the song "Growin' Up", Springsteen told a lengthy story about his parents telling him to give up music. They even sent him to talk with a priest.

Springsteen previewed "Sherry Darling", a song that would eventually end up on "The River."

Clarence Clemons' introduction of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)" featured bits of the Village People's "Macho Man."

The Agora concert came during Springsteen and the E Street Band's "Darkness Tour", promoting The Boss' "Darkness on the Edge of Town" album. The tour is considered by many fans to be Springteen's greatest concert trek.

Seven of the 10 songs from "Darkness on the Edge of Town" were performed at the Agora.

The album and tour marked a return for Springsteen after a public legal battle with his former manager kept him sidelined for two years.

Springsteen performed "Because of the Night", a song he wrote during the recording the "Darkness" sessions that became a hit for Patti Smith.

The final encore of "Twist and Shout" wasn't carried live.

During the Agora show, Springsteen and the band turned the less than 4-minute "Prove It All Night", from "Darkness on the Edge of Town" into a more than 10-minute epic, something they were known to do during live performances at that time.

The Agora show was one of five radio broadcasts on the "Darkness Tour."

Fans and critics consider Springsteen's Agora concert as his breakout moment, taking him from clubs to arena shows.

The show and its resulting bootlegs have been cited as having increased Springsteen's record sales moving forward.

The Agora bootleg was re-released in four-LP vinyl format in Europe during the mid-1980s and titled "The Teenage Werewolf."

The "Darkness Tour" also stopped at Richfield Coliseum on Aug. 30 1978 and for a pair shows on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day 1978/1979.

After his Aug. 30 show in Richfield, Springsteen stopped by the Agora three weeks after the legendary broadcast for a surprise performance with Southside Johnny and the Ashbury Jukes.
