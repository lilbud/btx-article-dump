C'mon, did anybody really doubt that Bruce Springsteen would someday play with the E Street Band again?

It took 10 years to get from breakup to reunion tour, but now that it's happening it seems completely natural. This isn't one of those cynical "let's cash in once more" rock deals. It's more like a brotherhood reaffirmed -- another payoff on the promise of those glory nights when Springsteen and the E Streeters made you believe anything was possible in rock 'n' roll.

Signs that the reunion was coming were evident in an interview Springsteen did with the Globe last fall, when he released his boxed set "Tracks." "I had some of the greatest nights of my life on stage with them", Springsteen said at the time. "I can't imagine at some point that we wouldn't do it again."

The time has come, as Springsteen and the E Street Band open a record-setting five-show run at the FleetCenter tonight. All the shows are sold out -- and the group is expected to gross a rather tidy $1.15 million per show. And that, of course, doesn't count merchandise sales.

But Springsteen has never played just for profit. He's a craftsman, not an entrepreneur: "I'm a synthesist. I'm always making music", he said last fall.

"And I make a lot of different kinds of music all the time."

Springsteen has not done any interviews during this tour -- not on its first leg, in Europe, and not now, in the States. But a skim through this writer's old notebooks shows that many of the things Springsteen has said through the years paint a consistent picture of an artist who takes rock music as seriously as anyone in the business.

On music as his career (1988): "I always knew that music was my job, my life, but I guess you question what you've got to offer, what you've got to say.

Music, from the beginning, always meant so much to me. And the biggest fear was that in some way I was wasting people's time. In the end, you never answer those questions completely or fully -- which is good, because once you do that you get smug."

On record sales (1988): "The first thing you've got to stop worrying about is how much your record is going to sell. If it starts to sell less, then that's OK. It's still the record I wanted to make."

On performance (1984): "You should just be intuitive. I never like to find myself thinking during a song, because you've got to be in that song at that time. So you don't have many distant thoughts -- those come after the show.

I'll go home and I'll get in bed and think about what I did tonight. I think you become self-conscious then."

On what he wanted his music to say (1998): "I always wanted my music to influence the life you were living emotionally -- with your family, your lover, your wife, and, at a certain point, with your children. So I aspired to write across a wide range of topics. I guess the only map I followed was what I found myself going through in my own life."

On his father's influence (1998): "In the early years, I found a voice that was my voice and partly my father's voice. But isn't that what you always do?

Why do kids at 5 years old go into the closet and put daddy's shoes on? Hey, my kids do it. Or they run in the car and come clunking out with your boots on. And I think that was part of what I was doing. It was the fuel and fire for a lot of songs, particularly on 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' and 'The River.' It's always been a central connection. Then you go beyond it and find your own life."

On being outside the music business (1996): "At this point, I see the music scene and music business as relatively inhospitable. But I feel a greater sense of purpose. I have a greater idea of what my job is, who I am, and what I want to do, not just this year but in the future. It's pretty much outside the general thrust of the music business, but that's OK."

On Hank Williams, one of his favorite songwriters (1980): "You always had that sense of rootlessness in all his stuff. It's not an outlaw or a rebel thing, which is funny because when I first started, people thought my characters were rebels, but I never thought they were. They were just normal people trying to live, period. Anyway, with Hank Williams's stuff, which I played while traveling around the country on the entire last tour, his words were just so beautiful and his songs were so real."

On social consciousness (1996): "In every study, the division of wealth is increasing in the US. And the debate is how much we are cutting back and can cut out of the budget -- not whether some people actually need more assistance. It's always how much money to take away. But what about the people who don't have much to start with? That's at the core of what I'm trying to do. It's a search for beauty, and in beauty there is hope, and in hope there is some sense of divine love, of faith, of community and possibility, of things that would combat the brutality and the violence and the suffering.

That's what I'm trying to lay out there. It's a survival guide."
