Irish fans working on the dream of seeing Bruce Springsteen play live in Croke Park this year have been quick to snap up tickets to his two summer concerts.

A total of 82,000 tickets available for the initial gig were gone within half an hour of going on sale yesterday at 9am. A second date was then announced and it too sold out, leaving some fans disappointed.

The River Tour 2016, in which Springsteen plays his 1980 double album in its entirety, has already proved a hit in the US and Canada.

Catriona O'Malley, 22, a English and History graduate from Maynooth, was one of the lucky ones. She waited in line outside Eason in Maynooth yesterday morning and secured a ticket within three quarters of an hour.

"I wanted to get a standing ticket for the Friday concert, but they were sold out", she said. "I got a seating ticket for Sunday, in the lower tier of the Hogan stand at Croke Park instead. I felt pretty happy about it --- I'm a big fan."

Margaret Leonard, 46, an Amnesty International worker from Tullyallen, near Drogheda, said she was Springsteen's No 1 fan and was determined to get a ticket online.

"The countdown began the night before when I logged into my account", she said. "I was up and at the computer at 9am the next morning and the tension was palpable --- it was a case of ticking all the boxes and watching the status change from 'Not on Sale' to 'On Sale' and then 'Processing'. I was aware of the virtual queue and afraid to touch anything on the computer until finally the sale was confirmed --- the second time round.

"I'm looking forward to catching up with friends from all over the world and enjoying this thing we have in common", she said. "The butterflies are terrible though. I have been having nightmares where I lose my tickets and I can't find the venue."

Prices for both gigs started at €65.45 for seats, €98.50 for standing and up to €131 for other areas of the concert venue, in addition to a charge for booking.

A spokesman for Aiken Promotions said yesterday there were no plans to add another Irish date to the tour.

Nick McDonnell, 31, a youth worker from Kells, Co Meath, was one of those who missed out.

"I was online on my laptop and also trying through the mobile app at 9am this morning", he said yesterday. "The app didn't work and I had a wait of 32 minutes online. My attempt eventually timed out and I got the 'No tickets are available' message."

Leaving for work, he arrived to find that another date had been added. "But the tickets were all gone for that too", he said. "On the way there I'd passed a Ticketmaster store in Navan and the queue was at least 50 plus, stretching past a few of the local shops."

Another disappointed fan was Niamh O'Brien, a 33-year-old marketing executive from Galway. She has seen Springsteen live on four occasions already and tried to get tickets online for two hours before giving up.

"At first, it seemed to be working, and I was delighted when two tickets for the lower Cusack stand came up", she said. "However, after going through the whole thing of booking and paying, I got a message saying, 'Sorry --- we're unable to process your request', and they just disappeared from my basket."

Her second and subsequent attempts also failed.

"Buying concert tickets in Ireland is an absolute nightmare", she added. "Not only do music fans here have to pay through the nose for tickets, we have to jump through virtual hoops to get them too."
