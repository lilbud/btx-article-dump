**Constant Meijers:** The second night you played a different show from the first one, why?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, the first night we played a set we've played a few times already, the song sequence fits well. The second night we played a new set, maybe the songs didn't follow each other that well, but there were moments which were better than the first one'. That's the reason why I changed the set; besides, I wanted to do something different because I realised that there were a lot of people who'd been there the night before. Both Dutch gigs were the gigs we've been looking forward to most, 'cause they've been almost one long show. I think I liked the second night better, that night I had a better feeling.

**CM:** The song sequence in the first part of the first show showed a clear concept from dreams to a disappointing reality, to solidarity in the promised land. This sequence was missing the second night.

**BS:** Well, we opened, the first night with 'Follow That Dream', which was the frame of the whole show'. The whole show is put together similar to the construction of the records; the second night we opened with 'Run Thru The Jungle', which is in fact the opposite of 'Follow That Dream'.

**CM:** Had the reaction of the crowd during the first night made you change your show?

**BS:** No, not really. Every crowd is different. On both nights I felt real full, as strong as iron. When the crowd jumps up and gets excited instead of sitting down and just listening, that doesn't touch me as much as in the earlier days. I know exactly what I'm doing, what I'm singing up there. You see, I come up and present my show; of course, you work up to an involvement with the people, but you got to present your ideas. At the end of an opening song like 'Follow That Dream', a strange feeling comes over me, like I'm right in the people's heads. That's the reason I start with that song, although really it's too slow to start a show, but because of that you make the people a bit doubtful, I see it as catching a deep breath, before making the big jump. 'Run Thru The Jungle' has the same effect, 'cause this song radiates the same mood of intimacy. But at the opening of a show, people don't expect intimacy, they want to get excited together, they want to jump up. So if you start calm, you take the people close to you from the beginning. Back in the States we've never done that, that's why I think that these shows are better.

**CM:** So you start with a piece of meditation, like John McLaughlin's minute of quiet?

**BS:** Something like that, especially with 'Follow That Dream' everything falls off me, so when I've finished it, I think "That's done, now we're gonna hit it!" The strange thing is that you feel you need guts to do that. But to take that risk gives me strength.

**CM:** At the beginning of 'Independence Day', 'Factory' and 'This Land Is Your Land', you gave three of your visions of the American Dream, the first night an intimate story about your father and grandfather, the second night you spoke about trying to see Elvis shortly before his death. Were you not afraid that stories like that would come over a bit stilted to Europeans?

**BS:** When we reached the point of leaving for Europe I told the band that we couldn't play 'This Land' in Europe. Well, I sing it now because I think that everybody can feel a certain alliance with this song, as well as the place where you live. Even if you don't agree with the government, or things in society, you can still feel a sort of alliance with your country, for instance you see that during wartime, 'cause every human being feels connected with a place. 'This Land' is about that feeling and about decency and respect. That song keeps a promise. This promise is one of the most essential characteristics.

**CM:** The feeling of optimism towards society and its chances lies on a higher level in the United States than in Europe.

**BS:** I'm not so sure about that. The promise as such is connected with human nature and everyone's longing for redemption. It's about proving your own possibilities; together with that there is also a feeling of solidarity, if it's only the possibility to pass on your own happiness to others, hoping that with sharing you can stimulate others. Boy, that song is so touching.

**CM:** In Holland it was a kind of party-hit by Trini Lopez; Woody Guthrie is almost unknown.

**BS:** That was like somebody in Europe, who asked why I used Status Quo's 'Rocking All Over The World' as an encore. I said "Gee, I thought that song was by John Fogerty", but it doesn't matter; in the States, Lopez' version was a hit too. What does matter to me is that it has been used as phoney flagwaving, while the essence of that song has to do with the struggle for life. It doesn't say anything about a statement, but a challenge, a question. We put it in the set after I read the Woody Guthrie book. That man wrote such a lot of great songs.

**CM:** Why did you do 'Stolen Car' only on the first night?

**BS:** Well, the second night we did 'Racing In The Street'; we've played 'Stolen Car' only a few times, though it's one of my favourite 'River' songs. I got to be in the mood to play it, to hit it.

**CM:** Besides the horrible theme of the song itself, it amazes me that you, while you're in quite a comfortable situation, you've been able to maintain such a sharp outlook on suffering.

**BS:** Everybody is afflicted with something, nobody is happier than another. Everyone bears expectations and fears. 'Stolen Car' has to do with the fear of isolation, a fear which everyone has, and which gets worse if you can't find the reason for it.

**CM:** You give the impression that you 'live' with the public.

**BS:** Yeah, I don't know; what we do, what we offer happens within an ideal situation, we reach a lot of young and older people all in one crowd. People who react differently to things seem to have a common interest. When the houselights go up I get the feeling that I belong to all these people and the people to me; this solidarity is what I'm after. In the States this means a community which acknowledges that everyone is different. If you're reasonable and being guided by human values, there's a common interest in the recognition of the variety of people in a community. It's about having respect for somebody else.

**CM:** At the same time you deal with the impossibilities of life. Your river doesn't just flow from A to B, it's at the same place at the same time and it's also a dividing line.

**BS:** The essence of 'The River' is militancy. Saying that you never have to do anything because you'll never reach the promised land, that's disastrous; it's about the old saying that 'life is the living'. By living you get a notion of certain values and of yourself. In the struggle to make an ideal true you find a meaning, by living you're searching for that meaning, that's what it's all about.

**CM:** What meaning is behind the disappointments that your characters in your songs come across?

**BS:** To face failures is one of the most important things that you have to learn. You have to face disappointments so that the fire that burns in you doesn't go out. You have to straighten out your problems. Those who take up with this are on this side of that slender lifeline; those who don't fight it will fall. They exist, but they have lost their strength of mind.

**CM:** Is this why 'promise' is the key word in your lyrics?

**BS:** To me, rock 'n' roll means: don't give up! Losing hope is becoming our greatest threat. The appearance has to be held up. The feeling that life holds a promise gives it a meaning and has to be respected.

**CM:** Then what exactly is it that makes life worth living?

**BS:** Good question! (laughs, enthusiastic) It's different for everybody. I can't think of a good answer to that quickly.

**CM:** I meant in relation to the characters in 'The River'!

**BS:** The point is that the meaning of life has to be found by living it. It seems in life that the disappointments are big and the victories small. Still there is something left, it's like a sediment, your biography. It fills you with a heart of stone. You start being someone; you get a sense of identity, what you want and what you believe. A lot of people never reach that stage because the walls are as high as life. I'm concerned with trying to destroy those walls so that people can meet themselves, see! In 'In Dreams' it says "Every man has a right to live / A right to a chance to give what he has to give". But what do we see? Crippled personalities, people who've never made themselves complete. They lock themselves up, filled with anger, and they join the National Socialists or the Ku Klux Klan, searching for an identity, a belief!

**CM:** From your records I understand that "the streets" form the stage for that hunt for an identity.

**BS:** Yeah, that's where you find the John Hinkleys. People who search outside themselves instead of on the inside. That possibility hasn't been presented to them in an understandable way.

**CM:** When you were talking about your old man and his old man, you said they spent their lives in a factory, because of lack of information about the forces controlling their lives. Isn't the same thing happening to all of us, but from an excess of information?

**BS:** You have to learn what is worthwhile and what isn't. Despite the excess of information, lack of knowledge is still contrastingly extreme. In school you learn a million facts without getting a straight understanding.

**CM:** Who teaches you to sift that information?

**BS:** You build up a system of values. Through values you can get the information. Such a system is - I hope - based on human values. Before 1975 I could hardly put my ideas into words. I wanted to make records, sound like Phil Spector, and other things. I have relatives who can't put their wishes and dreams into words, but they can feel intuitively what's good for them, what their expectations of life can fulfil. People don't know what they've got inside them and what they can do with themselves.

**CM:** Your solidarity with people can be heard in all your work, while you've obtained a lot yourself.

**BS:** Whether somebody has a lot of money and the possibility to buy things which thinks make you happy, makes no difference to me. I'm concerned with poverty of spirit: mental poverty. Of course social injustice does exist, but the difference between dying like a rich man but poisoned with drugs, like Elvis, and dying like a poor man with an old coat - that's what it's all about to me. There are all sorts of poverty and richness. A lot of my friends don't have a thing, but they know how to stay alive. Religion? I don't know the causes that have brought me here. The only thing I know is that when I was a kid I heard something and what I heard was more than I could think of at the time. Though I knew it was important enough to me to fight for. I went back to Hank Williams and Jimmy Rodgers, to soul and spirituals. Suddenly I found what I had heard back in the old rock 'n' roll records. Or read in that fantastic book 'American Dreams, Lost and Found' by Studs Terkel, or seen in the movie 'The Grapes of Wrath'.

**CM:** Don't you have the feeling that your childhood comes back to you, including your religion?

**BS:** It never left me. You carry that with you for the rest of your life. Religion I don't really feel tied with, because my Catholic education taught me to have fear. This is a religious experience in which you don't look up to heaven but to the people around you.

**CM:** Could your attempt to escape the dogma of your childhood be your most important motivation?

**BS:** I still remember what first frightened me: the devil. When my grandma said what the devil looked like, I got so scared, I thought he lived on our pavement. I never had the guts to go out alone! I was truly convinced that the devil was on my front porch! That kind of fear is demolishing and shameful because it darkens the spirit of religion. In spite of it all I like to walk into a church if I want to. Not for what happens on the altar, but to experience the feeling of people around me. In Spain I walked into a beautiful cathedral; when I looked up I saw a lot of details that quite struck me. The atmosphere was so immense that being in that church gave me a bigger feeling of infinity than heaven outside.

**CM:** Has that something to do with a feeling of eternity? With conquering death?

**BS:** No, it's not a feeling to do with not having to die. It's a feeling of being part of all that lived, died and was followed by new life. It is even the opposite: a feeling of mortality and in what way you're part of all things.

**CM:** During 'Stolen Car' a lot of people held lights up. It gave the atmosphere of candles in a mass service.

**BS:** Yeah...it's something. (Laughs briefly)
