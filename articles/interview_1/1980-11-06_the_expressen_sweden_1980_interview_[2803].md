"Springsteen has burned the tapes!" "Springsteen is crazy!"

But the Bruce Springsteen I meet is healthy and strong. Bruce told the Expressen: "When there's a long time between records a lot of stupid rumors get around.

One paper prints them and suddenly they are the truth and I'm supposed to be crazy."

Springsteen is of course not crazy, and he hasn't burned the tapes. What about the new LP, "The River"?: "I had 45 songs to choose between and made a double album out of them. The title track is the best I've done! It's in the "No Nukes" movie."

This is no proper interview with Bruce Springsteen, rather the result of an informal series of talks during three weeks in L.A. Bruce and producer Jon Landau were there to mix "The River."

"I've been on the West Coast for so long, but it's been like a holiday. Look - my first sunburn for five years!"

When the album is released a gigantic Springsteen tour starts, and it's planned to finish in Europe in spring. 1975 saw him doing four European concerts, two in London and one each in Amsterdam and Sweden. That's the only gigs he's done outside North America!: "I regret that we haven't returned to Europe before, but we're home-loving guys and we prefer the USA. But it was a kick to come to Europe and discover that everybody knew about us and knew our songs."

What about the manager and contract problems he had? Springsteen put out no records for three years: "I was in a trap. The classic story about the guy who signs an idiotic contract. I said No to any records, but I played like a maniac, because that's what I like, playing in front of an audience."

"Everything went so fast. I was on the cover of Time and Newsweek and on the way to becoming something I wasn't and I didn't want to be. I was on the way to being sucked up in the music biz and exploited."

Many people say that it's impossible to keep your own personality and at the same time be a superstar in the music industry: "Bullshit! It's just to say No - in time. If you're young and suddenly turn famous, everything is lying in front of you - girls, booze, drugs and stuff like that. If you start taking drugs you're an easy victim for the record company."

"I said No to everything! No, I bought a house and a car. I'm living the same way I've always done. Still with the same friends and nearly the same band as in my teens."

"Up to the "Darkness" LP we were constantly broke. I could have been rich by now, but I feel a great satisfaction that I never sold myself to drugs or the record company."

"Rich or poor, however you see it, I'm in a very enviable situation. I can sleep in the mornings and do what I like best in the evenings - play!" It's more than two years since "Darkness on the Edge of Town" came out. Making a record is a long process for Springsteen: "Of course I could have done an album a year, but would they have been good? I have responsibility to myself and the fans. I won't release anything I'm not satisfied with, what I don't have my heart and soul in. When I release the new album both I and the fans know that it's good. If people aren't ready to wait, then they weren't interested in the first place."

As a passionate record collector and rock lover he also feels a big responsibility towards older rock music. All his concerts feature old rock classics: "I've got the same musical background as most 31-year-olds: Stones, Beatles, Kinks. When the guitar solos went on too long at the end of the 60s I lost interest. Luckily my elder cousin had a goldmine of singles. All rock, R&B and soul from the 40s and 50s. There I found my roots. I play these old songs on stage because I want to show young fans that it wasn't Van Halen or some other idiot who discovered rock music."

Bruce is satisfied with his records so far, but says about the "Darkness" album: "Today I think it's too dark. I'm really a happy person - that will show on the new album."

Any favorite records you listen to now?

"When I work on an album I don't listen to any other music. I'm very easily influenced, and if there's a lot of good music I'll pick up riffs and sounds from so many records that in the end I won't know what's mine. But I can give you one name I'll always stand for: Graham Parker. Why he isn't bigger in the States is remarkable and a shame."

When we were talking about old records I mentioned that the Sir Douglas Quintet had reformed. Bruce exclaimed: "What?! My God, that's one of the legendary groups. In the beginning of the 70s I played a lot with Augie Meyers in Texas and I felt like a fan, I loved that music."

Today Jon Landau, prominent rock critic, is producer and manager of Bruce Springsteen. It was Landau who made the famous quote "I have seen rock future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen", and he and Bruce have become good friends: "I produced some records when I was at college, so I wasn't worried when Bruce asked me to help him in the studio. I had no experience as a manager, but when Bruce asked me I agreed."

He stopped writing ("After ten years as a rock writer I had said all I wanted to say") and devoted his time wholly to Bruce: "As you have seen, Bruce is a very special artist. He is his own boss and tells everyone what to do. But that's good, it makes him unique and exciting. Now he'll come to Europe. I think it'll be in March, because it's really cold in January and February."
