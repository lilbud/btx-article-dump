It was 2 a.m. last Friday, and Bruce Springsteen was still wide awake.

Somewhere around midnight, he had finished a monumental, four- hour marathon at the Civic Center, but instead of filing back to his hotel to sleep or watch a late movie, he was sitting backstage, greeting well-wishers and music-biz reps into the wee hours.

"After I've done a show, I'm never tired", said the man known as The Boss, who performs tonight and tomorrow at Boston Garden. "I'm always really awake,and I stay awake for hours and hours. I don't go to bed until 6:30, or something like that."

Rather than hide from people after a show, Springsteen said: "It's good to have that immediate contact ...a lot of people who come in are working for you on your record, or doing something for you in some way, so it's good to meet people like that."

To put it another way, the 31-year-old Springsteen remains down to earth.

Although his concerts have been rapid-fire sellouts across the country, and his double-album "The River" has topped the charts, he still doesn't play the aloof, condescending games of so many other superstars.

In a trademark gesture, he still dives into the audience during his show, the reason being that "we try to maintain the aspect of real people being in the audience and also on stage."

In Providence, however, in an example of just how popular Springsteen has become, he couldn't stay in the crowd for more than 20 seconds. "I got attacked and jumped right back up again", he said, as he forced a shy grin during our interview. "Some nights you meet four or five 15-year-old girls, and you can't continue because they go nuts sometimes. There's got to be a two-way street when you go down in the crowd: One is that you got to want it, and the other part is they want to let you."

It is no secret that Springsteen lives for his performances ("I focus everything around the time I spend on stage"), and clearly no contemporary rock artist puts more of himself into his act.

He sometimes gets a faraway look in his eyes on stage, but that doesn't mean his thoughts are anywhere else. "No, you should just be intuitive. I never like to find myself thinking during a song, because you got to be IN that song at that time ...So you don't have many distant thoughts \- those come after the show. I'll go home and I'll get in bed and think about what I did tonight.

I think you become self-conscious then....

Only five years ago though, Springsteen said, he was much more self- conscious on stage. He was in the middle of management problems and an identity crisis, and both took their toll. "I was very self-conscious on stage, and it was killing me. I hated it. It was right after the Born to Run' album, on that first tour ...I had uncontrollable self-doubts which manifested themselves even while I was playing. It was sort of that thing, Who is this guy on stage, and you ain't so sure."

"I was 25 then, and I had been playing for 10 years, but even with all that amount of time under my belt, I still just didn't know myself. I had a lot of questions ...I knew that music was my job, my life, but I guess you question what you got to offer, what you got to say. Music, from the beginning, always meant so much to me, and the biggest fear was that in some way I was wasting people's time ...In the end you never answer those questions completely or fully - which is good - because once you do that you get smug."

Does he still have self-doubts? "You have to, but it's different. I made it through that particular time, and I'm five, six years down the road. We're still playing. Nothing stopped. I guess there was a fear at that time that something was going to stop ...But what counts is that you're still out there, and I feel the very best this tour that I've ever felt."

Springsteen's renewed self-confidence suffuses "The River" LP, where he was finally able to loosen his often fussy, and time- consuming, songwriting style. Asked about country singer Hank Williams' dictum that if you can't write a song in 15 minutes you should throw it out, Springsteen said: "My problem was that if I wrote a song in 15 minutes, then I would throw it out.

This album was the first album where I wrote some songs really fast. Like the song, Hungry Heart', I wrote in about 10 minutes ...Yeah, you can get obsessed with details, and while I spent a lot of time on the selection and sequencing of songs on the album, in the actual recording and writing I tried to be as spontaneous as possible."

And speaking of Hank Williams, Springsteen has become a big fan, even borrowing the "down by the river" imagery from Williams' "Long Gone Lonesome Blues" to form the title cut of "The River" album. "I was sitting in my bedroom one night. I was just there with my guitar, and all of a sudden I started singing, down by the river' ...I couldn't think of the rest of the song; all I could think of was that particular image."

"It wasn't until the last tour that I started to get into country music, and Hank Williams in particular", said Springsteen. "I thought, I think there's something similar between this and my stuff.' It seemed really realistic to me, really genuine, and it had a lot of highway on it. And you always had that sense of rootlessness in all his stuff. It's not an outlaw or a rebel thing, which is funny because when I first started people thought my characters were rebels, but I never thought they were. They were just normal people just trying to live, period ...Anyway, with Hank Williams' stuff - which I played while traveling around the country on the entire last tour - his words were just so beautiful, and his songs were so real."

As for Springsteen's other thoughts these days, he shared the following: John Lennon's death: "Well, this I don't want to talk about. There will be a million words said about it, and none can really express it. I think it's a personal thing for everybody, and it's just too personal for me."

Boston Garden: "I was worried the last time there, but it was one of the best shows, and best audiences, of the tour. It's sweaty there, and I like that."

The American Dream: "It's never what you thought it would be. When you're young, you have the stock dream - of all the girls in the world and the big house - but when you get there most of those stock dreams don't fit. They're childish. I find for me that just being out on the road, and playing and doing what I do, is what I want."
