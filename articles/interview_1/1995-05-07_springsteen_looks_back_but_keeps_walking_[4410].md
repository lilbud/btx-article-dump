"BROOOOOOOCE!" So went the cries of nearly a dozen police officers as Bruce Springsteen walked past the 18th Precinct station house on West 54th Street.

As he strolled through midtown Manhattan on a sunny weekday afternoon, no other pedestrians stopped him or yodeled his first name. They just looked at him as he passed by, trying to quietly absorb his presence with their gaze in the jaded way that New Yorkers respond to fame. It was only the police officers who reacted, pulling out their summons pads for Mr. Springsteen to sign and yelling, "You're the best!" as he complied.

"I have a healthy fan base in law enforcement", Mr. Springsteen, 45, said with a staccato laugh as he turned on to Eighth Avenue, beginning one of the few interviews he has granted during his two-decade career, which has recently taken yet another upswing.

Rock musicians and police officers aren't supposed to mix. It's a tradition that goes back to the day the blues musician Robert Johnson went to the crossroads and supposedly made a deal with the Devil. But since Mr.

Springsteen emerged from Asbury Park, N. J., in the early 1970's, firing off hit songs like "Born to Run", "Hungry Heart" and, more recently, "Streets of Philadelphia", he has changed the rules of rebellion.

He imbued the daily struggles of those in the working class with a quotidian heroism, telling them that they mattered and assuring them that there was nothing wrong with trying to realize a dream, even if their attempt failed.

"Spend your life waiting for a moment that just don't come", he sings in "Badlands", a 1978 song on his newly released "Greatest Hits" album on Columbia. "Well, don't waste your time waiting."

"A lot of rock-and-roll music was concerned with the outlaw", Mr. Springsteen said. "But I liked the idea of 'High Noon' and the ambivalent sheriff. My characters were people who had something to be gained and lost by stepping in either direction. They were misfits more than outlaws."

Since Mr. Springsteen's heyday in the early and mid-1980's, times have changed -- and so has Mr. Springsteen. In 1989, he divorced his first wife, the model Julianne Phillips, and started dating the woman who would become his second, Patti Scialfa, a member of his backup group, the E Street Band. That same year, he dismissed the band and, in 1990, bought his third home, a $14 million estate in Beverly Hills (he also has a farm near his hometown, Freehold, N. J., and a house in nearby Rumson).

For fans who saw Mr. Springsteen as one of the few rock stars who hadn't forgotten what it was like to be a regular human being, these actions were confusing. The relative lack of enthusiasm with which fans and critics greeted his 1992 albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town", led some to wonder how relevant Mr. Springsteen was in the 90's.

But in the past year, the pendulum has started to swing in Mr. Springsteen's direction again. He received four Grammys and an Oscar for his title song to the movie "Philadelphia", reunited with the E Street Band to record six additional songs for "Greatest Hits" (three of which ended up on the record) and watched the album shoot to No. 1 on the pop charts the week it was released. Its first new hit, a previously unreleased 1982 song called "Murder Incorporated", about the proliferation of guns and the devaluation of human life, sounds even more appropriate today than it did when it was written.

"I BELIEVE THAT THE BASIC IDEAS and the values that I wrote into all those songs on the album are still relevant", Mr. Springsteen said. "When I wrote them, I wanted to write about things that people always have to go through at some point in their lives. My music wasn't going to be about fashion or style.

It was going to be about family and struggle and identity questions, spiritual questions: Who am I? Where am I going? How do you live an honest life, and is it possible? How do you make the kinds of connections that keep you from the worst of yourself and bring out the best of yourself? And then there's fun and good times -- how do you find them?"

During that afternoon walk, Mr. Springsteen had his choice of good times: he could find them in Central Park or he could find them in Hannah's Cocktail Lounge, a few blocks from the police station. It took two seconds for Mr.

Springsteen to choose the latter. He settled into a table near the window in the front of the small, empty bar, then changed his mind. He wanted a table in the back corner, where no sunlight penetrated. His age didn't show in his ruddy cheeks, tousled dark hair, husky frame and cross-shaped earring. "If anybody could make you dream, it's Bruce Springsteen", says Melissa Etheridge, who models her impassioned performances after Mr. Springsteen's. But on that day, he seemed more ready to shatter dreams than inspire them.

He downed a shot of tequila, took a sip from his beer chaser and talked about his recent metamorphosis. Having children -- Evan James, 4, Jessica Rae, 3, and Sam Ryan, 1 -- pulled him out of his solipsistic world, he said, and not just because he now has to wake up every morning at 8:30 and drive the two oldest to school in his black Ford Explorer.

"I think that before I had kids I was waiting for my life to begin", he said.

"It was always, 'When this happens, when that happens.' And all of a sudden one morning I woke up and that feeling was just gone. It felt to me like the beginning of some life that I had worked really hard and waited very long to get to. I was 40 years old when I had kids, and so I was already at the point where the interesting things for me felt like they were going to be over there -- away from bars and running around -- and closer to children and relationships and deeper satisfactions."

On "Greatest Hits", one can hear these changes taking place. It begins with visions of freedom and the open road in "Born to Run", matures with the 35-year-old father in "My Hometown" who knows he's lying to himself when he talks of packing his bags and escaping, and ends with the fatalistic wisdom of "Blood Brothers", a song about the E Street Band. In his slightly hoarse voice he sings, "The hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away, making a fool's joke out of the promises we make."

"The songs are not literally autobiographical", he said. "But in some way they're emotionally autobiographical. As they go by, you see your own take on the world and how it's changed since you were a kid. You create a variety of different characters, and the thing they have in common is some emotional thread you've tried to use to make your own way through what can feel like a particularly imponderable existence."

Songs have not always been enough for Mr. Springsteen to help him weave his way through life. One of the biggest steps he ever had to take, he said, was 13 years ago, when he decided to undergo therapy, which he continues sporadically. "I grew up in a working-class family, where that was frowned upon", he said. "It was very, very difficult for me to ever get to a place where I said I needed some help. I stumbled into some different, very dark times where I simply had no other idea of what to do. It's not necessarily for everybody, but all I can say is, I've accomplished things personally that felt simply impossible previously. The leap of consciousness that it takes to go from playing in your garage to playing in front of 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people or when you experience any kind of success at all can be very, very demanding."

Mr. Springsteen has made the transition from garage-rocker to arena-rocker better than most rock singers. He doesn't have to try to be sincere; it comes naturally. In the 1970's, at the height of rock-star decadence, Mr. Springsteen set himself apart from his contemporaries by rarely indulging in anything but a sweaty, energetic three- or four-hour show. In the 1990's, it's now in vogue for rockers to resent their large following, but Mr. Springsteen continues to embrace his wholeheartedly. His vision from the beginning was that the band should be a fan's rock group. In fact, "Murder Incorporated" was included on "Greatest Hits" solely because of one fan's persistence.

"For years, there's this guy that's been following me around with a 'Murder Incorporated' sign", Mr. Springsteen said. "I see him in the audience like every five shows. I have never played the song, ever, in concert and would have no intent to do so, and yet this guy follows me around with this sign and flashes it during the entire show. So it was he who I had in mind when we put the song on the album. We said, 'Let's put this on for that guy, whoever he is.' "

In the introduction to a book about Mr. Springsteen, one fan describes his idol in bold capital letters as "real." Mr. Springsteen prefers the word "grounded", but real is what comes to mind when one meets him. Sitting at Hannah's Cocktail Lounge, he came on like a good-natured lumberjack ready to chop down the trees that separate him from his audience. He urged on the conversation with lines like "Let's not stop now" and ordered new beers every time one started to get warm. He seemed ready to talk about each subject for an hour or two -- if only to avoid an awkward silence.

The topic Mr. Springsteen constantly returned to was the E Street Band, which has been with him through his best years. A poet in auto mechanic's clothing, he was first signed to a record label during the tail end of the Nixon years; he and the band were one of the few groups in a politically cynical time that still thought rock could change the world. Mr. Springsteen and the band's fame peaked during the Reagan 1980's, when they gave voice to those grasping for a meaningful life in a system that did not seem to value them. Now that Congressional Republicans are trying to undo 60 years of social reform, perhaps there's no better time for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band to return and let those blue-collar voices be heard from again.

"It's very strange that the Republicans are coming back now", Mr. Springsteen said. "Because my idea in the early and mid-1980's was to put forth an alternate vision of the America that was being put forth by the Reagan-era Republicans. They basically tried to co-opt every image that was American, including me. I wanted to stake my own claim to those images, and put forth my own ideas about them. The band drew me in that direction, and that's the direction that I want to work in in the future with them."

Mr. Springsteen's reunion with the E Street Band, whom he hasn't recorded with in 10 years, is not just symbolic. In his view, people perceived his solo work, on albums like "Nebraska", "Tunnel of Love" and "Lucky Town", as very personal and psychological. The E Street Band, he said, is like a bridge connecting him with his fans, broadening the scope of his writing. Equally important, he said the band's easy camaraderie keeps him from slipping into what he called "the abyss of self-destructiveness."

A prolific songwriter but notoriously slow when it comes to releasing records, Mr. Springsteen, nonetheless, wants to finish recording a solo album in the next few weeks and record an album with the band this summer. He hopes to change his relationship with the band. "I simply want to do both things, like what Neil Young does with Crazy Horse", he explained. "He'll go and do a project with different musicians, and then he'll come back and play with Crazy Horse when he has something that feels right for them."

Steve Van Zandt, the guitarist who left the E Street Band in 1984 but has now rejoined it, said that Mr. Springsteen's plan seemed like a good idea. "We talked about it years ago", he said. "I really felt that was the way to go."

In addition to the new songs on the "Greatest Hits" album, Mr. Springsteen also recently completed a song for the Sean Penn film "The Crossing Guard" and wrote for and helped produce a forthcoming album by Joe Grushecky, a Pittsburgh rock musician. The thrill of playing blues guitar with the roots- rock band Blasters at a recent concert of theirs, he said, has led him to start "toying around with the idea of making a record that's centered around loud guitars." He has also been listening to the punk band Social Distortion and Wayne Kramer, the former guitarist with the proto-punk group MC5.

MR. SPRINGSTEEN IS LESS enthusiastic about the Grammy and Academy Awards he recently won for "Streets of Philadelphia." "I didn't win any awards for so long, so I devalued them because it was necessary", he said, guffawing so hard that his shoulders shook. "Those are pretty conservative organizations, and all the actual rock records I've made over the years have been ignored. But I had a nice night at the Oscars, and I was really sort of appreciative, and my mother came and got to see me win instead of lose. In the early 1980's, we did a benefit for the Vietnam Veterans Association, and all the guys gave me a helmet that they had signed. So I think that was the nicest award I've ever received."

Growing older has enabled Mr. Springsteen to look back at his past with perspective and, at times, curiosity. In "Thunder Road", recorded in 1975, the protagonist tries to explain to the woman he is speaking to that she is not too old to escape her dead-end life. "So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore", he tells her.

"I was 24 when I wrote that", Mr. Springsteen said, pausing to laugh at himself. "I listen to that now and think, 'Hey, wait a minute.' It's really strange, that line, and the one in 'Rosalita' -- 'Someday we'll look back on this, and it will all seem funny.' Those were two good ones, you know. I have no idea where I was conceivably coming from at that time."

Mr. Springsteen can make fun of his songs and ambition now. But the truth is, he tried to make music and plan his career so that he would regret nothing: "I didn't want to be rocking on my porch when I was 70 years old going, 'Oh, man, I should have taken a shot at this.' "

When it was pointed out to him that in an interview he did three years ago, he used the same image about sitting on his porch, but that the age he mentioned was 60 instead of 70, he laughed again. "There you go", he said. "The older you get, the younger you are. At 60, I plan to be still doing it. We're moving it up as we go. It will be 80 in another five years."
