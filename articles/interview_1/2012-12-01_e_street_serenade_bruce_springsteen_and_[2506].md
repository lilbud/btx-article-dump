IN SEPTEMBER 1974, a Swedish journalist was interviewing a rock singer pretty much unknown in Sweden. His name was Bruce Springsteen.

"Are you a pessimist?" the journalist asked.

"No, I think I'm real optimistic", Springsteen quickly replied. But listening to him talk during that interview, it's hard not to hear weariness in his voice.

"As you go along", he said, "it gets more difficult. It's like blocks. You've got your first block and the second one, and then you've got to put something on top of that and it gets higher each time."

Springsteen was not selling enough records. Columbia, his record company, was deliberating as to whether he was worth the effort. His one ally there, Clive Davis, had left the label. Possibly the situation was down to the way both he and his manager Mike Appel were behaving. Springsteen stubbornly refused to give up any artistic control, while Appel was out and about haranguing radio stations and Columbia, telling them that they were a bunch of schmucks for not being 100% supportive of his protégé.

To Jerry Gilbert of ZigZag, Springsteen admitted that he hadn't paid the band in three weeks: "Rents are due, and alimony, and we just don't have the money."

Things had not always been that tough. Fifteen months earlier, he didn't have to try. The future was looking bright. He had one album under his belt and the money to make another. Everything was about to come together. The album would be called The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle.

"Blackie's down by the railroad track, he sinks low in the backseat of his Cadillac..." So begins Bruce Springsteen's whispered elegy to the Big City. It was April 1973 and he called it 'New York Song'. In those days his songs never stayed the same for long. They might change title, verse and chorus in the space of a day or a week. This was just another small step in a progression that had started in earnest since he had decided to put the guitar down for a while and try to do something all the other guitar players couldn't do - write songs.

Initially they were hard to come by. The songs had little real definition and few melodic hooks. Mike Appel, who believed in him when no one else did, saw something in them but told him to go write some more. By the time Appel managed to bludgeon his way into the offices of legendary Columbia producer and talent scout John Hammond, Springsteen had a few really good ones, including 'Growin' Up' and 'Its Hard to be a Saint in the City'.

Apart from the songs, Hammond - along with Appel - recognised Springsteen's extraordinary faith in himself, a star quality. At Hammond's instigation Springsteen headed for 914 Sound Studios to make his first album, Greetings from Asbury Park. But in the process of becoming a songwriter, Springsteen had left behind a bunch of musicians who had played with him in various bands of the previous five years. These he called up to join him on the album. By the time it was finished, he had written two more songs that were to serve him in good stead, 'Spirit in the Night' and 'Blinded by the Light'. The former became a live favourite and the latter was eventually a hit for Manfred Mann.

But there was a one-dimensional quality to Springsteen's songwriting at this point. As many reviewers remarked when Greetings came out, the songs were so riddled with imagery, so packed with more words, that it was as if he wanted to get everything down in case he never had the chance to do it again.

The songs were just plain eccentric. They did a certain job, though. He didn't sound like anybody else, not even Bob Dylan - a comparison that was often wheeled out by critics at the time. They also went down a storm at his concerts: 'Spirits in the Night', 'Bishop Danced', 'Thundercrack', 'Blinded...', 'Hard to be Saint...', 'Growin' Up', 'Does this Bus Stop at 82nd St?'. Springsteen toured these songs on 130 dates all over the Eastern States, often as a support act, doing forty-minute sets or less.

With Clarence Clemons on saxophone, Danny Federici on organ, Garry Tallent on bass and Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez on drums, it was a solid band. But the formula was lacking something. Columbia gave the green light to book the studio for a second album, and this time Springsteen came up with something altogether different.

Various factors could be attributed as to why The Wild, the Innocent and the E St Shuffle is such a special album and why Springsteen's songwriting matured so much around the time of these sessions. Even though the first album had not sold well, he had no reason to take this badly and there was little pressure on him at the time. He knew the studio already and felt relaxed there. Mike Appel was out there fighting his battles for him, albeit a little too zealously. The band was no longer a new combination: they had paid their dues on the road, a circuit that offered little glamour, and were still there for him.

But there were two big changes. Danny Federici had not played on the first album, although he was gigging with Springsteen at the time. His organ and accordion sound would contribute hugely to the sound of the second one. The main contribution, though, would come from another part-time band member, pianist David Sancious.

Sancious was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and began playing music on a cheap guitar at the age of four. Two years later he went on to learn the piano. His parents loved music, whether it was jazz, classical, rock or blues.

They passed this on to their three sons. David, however, was to take it quite a few steps further.

David Sancious: I left high school when I was 15 years old, which in New Jersey at that time you could do without your parents' consent. I had already been playing in clubs since I was about 13. I lied about my age for a lot of years. I was 19 years old for about six years. Yeah, for at least five or six years I was 19 years old. I don't think anyone believed me because I had a really young face and a young voice, but I got away with it a lot.

Right after school I worked a few jobs, got a job in a guitar factory - the Danelectro guitar factory - for awhile. I worked as a landscaper for a while, you know, stuff like that, and then playing on the weekends. I was pretty much restricted to that. Out of school, all I did was music full-time. I was either practising at home by myself every day, and at night I would just play, wherever I could play, as much as possible.

There were a lot of bands playing along the Jersey shore at the time, many breaking up and reforming into different incarnations. It was almost inevitable that Sancious would eventually run into Springsteen.

**DS:** I met Bruce at Upstage - a club in Asbury Park - through Gary Tallent.

Gary and I had met and worked together before. I think we did a recording session for someone at a studio session and we hit it off right away. One night we were going to Upstage and Bruce was putting a jam session together for the second half of the night, which used to run from one o'clock until five in the morning. I was walking up the stairs and Gary introduced me to Bruce. Bruce asked if I was interested in playing in our jams. I said sure. We were used to playing for hours at a time and that was the start of it. He had a band called Steel Mill that he was going to break up.

We closed the place. It was five o'clock in the morning and we were walking out, and at that hour the last thing you can do is go right home and go to bed and go to sleep so we all used to, you know, walk down to the ocean and hang out. If you live nearby, you're walking home or catching a ride back to Belmar or wherever you came from. And we were walking out of the club and he said, "I'm going to be breaking up Steel Mill and starting a new band, would you be interested?" I said, "Yeah, absolutely". He was going to start this new band which became, eventually, the E Street Band. It wasn't called that for a long time, it was just Bruce Springsteen. Then we had a band called Dr Zoom & the Sonic Boom. That was like a kind of Mad Dogs & Englishmen thing, music and theatre at the same time.

Before meeting Bruce I was just like everybody else, just in that club scene you know, I was more concerned about getting really good on the instrument and I'd also sort of secretly started playing guitar around that time, which I kind of kept to myself for a while and then I broke it out one night. But that was it, just the club scene around Asbury Park, a lot of practising and jam sessions.

Southside Johnny: It was really a great crucible and sort of our college, because we were teenagers back then, and we learned so many styles of music, country and western, blues, guitar rock, because no one ever said no to anything. They were all, "I'm gonna be a musician", not "I'm gonna try to be a musician". They were so determined that was going to be what they did. No fallback, no college, no learn another craft, forget it.

Sancious did not play continuously with Springsteen. He played on Greetings from Asbury Park, most notably on 'Lost in the Flood', but afterwards returned to where he was based in Richmond, Virginia, and was not part of the band that toured to promote the album.

But in the words of Danny Federici, who had known him from playing around the area years before, Sancious "disappeared from the scene for a few years and then he came back as this unbelievable piano player". When he joined the sessions for the second album he had become a truly gifted player, able to move effortlessly from one genre to another, fitting in with whatever was happening musically at the time. His part in the sessions seemed to glue together a lot of elements in the general sound of the band. At least four or five of the tracks that would eventually make it on to the album were already recorded when Sancious joined the sessions, but when it was finished he would be all over it, especially the second side. He was joining up with a band that had been together for two years.

**DS:** We weren't the only good musicians around the shore, but it was a collection of pretty much the best players who were around that area at that time, you know. Bruce was absolutely the guitar hero of the whole area. The band was always really interesting. Vini Lopez had a really unique style, Gary's a fantastic bass player, Danny's great on the organ and accordion...and Clarence, of course.

The producers' roles were once again taken up by Mike Appel and his partner Jim Cretecos, but subject to Springsteen's vision. 914 Sound Studios were situated in Rockland County, a few miles into New York State over the border from New Jersey. As with the sessions for the first album, Mike Appel had chosen 914 as a way to economise.

**DS:** I remember that when we started the recording for the album, everybody was a little run down physically. Clarence had tonsillitis, I had a kind of cold or something, you know it was a bunch of people who were just working, because you had to do that, and then everybody got better of course, and carried on.

But I do remember the atmosphere in the sessions as being fairly relaxed, not too uptight, not too tense, but it was a lot of work. We worked a lot of hours. We started in the morning, we used to drive up to 914 from New Jersey and then I think they put us in a hotel across the road from it or something.

But we put in a really seriously full day and night.

Some reports suggest that the musicians slept in tents at the back of the studio.

**DS:** There was a place where you could go in the back of the studio and crash out for a while if you were tired. I definitely remember everybody taking advantage of that at some point .I don't remember a tent. It doesn't mean it wasn't there.

Springsteen set about recording some songs already written and some that developed during the sessions.

'The E Street Shuffle' is one of the latter, an instruction to a dance step that one might spontaneously start up at a party. Springsteen would write these songs all through his career to get the crowd moving at his concerts.

Albee Tellone, Springsteen's sound manager at the time, recalls that the song was in its infancy when Sancious joined. Seeing him and Springsteen working on it at the pianist's house, he assumed that they had written it together. The song snaps and fizzes like a firecracker out of control. The band would play it fast and on another night play it slow.

Along with 'The 'E Street Shuffle', 'Kitty's Back' is another track that would bolster Springsteen's live shows, each made up of different sections which could be expanded to allow each musician to solo if necessary. Set to a tune reminiscent of Van Morrison's 'Moondance', with the title taken from an advertisement at a Stripper's Lounge, it starts with Springsteen's spare guitar, playing clipped notes like Robbie Robertson, and leads into a jazz mix of organ and horns.

There is so much going on in these two songs. Where Springsteen went into lyrical overdrive on his first album, here he achieves a similar effect musically. He would never again get so near to jazz until the Seeger Sessions tour of 2006.

'Wild Billy's Circus Story' had been in the band's live itinerary over the previous year. It describes the colourful elements of circus life and how a young boy becomes drawn into it. Springsteen later recalled the song was "a black comedy based on my memories of the fairs and the Clyde/Beatty Circus that visited Freehold" [Springsteen's hometown] when he was a kid.

Bruce Springsteen: They'd set up a midway and pitch their tents in a field across from the racetrack not far from my house. It was also a song about the seduction and loneliness of a life outside the margins of everyday life. At 24, already having spent a good deal of time on the road, for better or worse, that was the life I wanted to lead.

Springsteen managed to bring together the combination of the wondrous and the scary facets of the carny life, made vivid by Garry Tallent's tuba and Federici's accordion.

It's on '4th July Asbury Park (Sandy)' and the three tracks on the second side of the album that everything changed. Where all Springsteen's previous songs were packed full of almost cartoon-like city scenarios, these four songs have much more characterisation and sense of place. Even though the main character in the songs may not be Springsteen exactly, these were his first attempts at credible narrative. He began to write of love and hurt, triumph and failure, set in the vibrant world of the Jersey boardwalk and the harsher one of New York City. His phrasing has more flow .The melodies are unforgettably gorgeous.

'Sandy' is a magical song, the singer telling his friend/girlfriend how things aren't going his way anymore, that the summer and the summer scene is probably over. With the melodramatic introspection of a 22-year-old, he tells her they should get out of town. This is where Danny Federici really shines. His accordion evokes the calliope sounds of the carousels on the New Jersey, shore while Sancious' electric piano sprinkles stardust over the top.

Whether he intended it or not, the three tracks that make up the second side have an operatic and thematic whole, even if they do lack a continuous storyline. They blend into each other so well that, to some listeners, they will always follow each other. It also says something about the ease that Springsteen must have felt at the time.

'Incident on 57th Street' may be the greatest song Springsteen ever wrote.

Starting and finishing with Sancious' trickling piano, the story of Spanish Johnny and Puerto Rican Jane evokes many story lines from the movies of the '50s and '60s. Johnny wants to lead the straight and narrow life for his girl, but keeps being drawn back to the criminal world of the Big City .The air is hot and damp. The languor suggests that nothing will really change.

Springsteen talked in 1974 about how, compared to New York, growing up in Jersey gave him a little more room to make choices:

I was fortunate enough to have the option of splitting to the city. When it got too much I could always go back. There were a lot of cats that didn't have that particular option, so I tried to choose the best of both worlds. I can write optimistically about a lot of tough subjects, how good it is to be in the city in the summer, but a lot of people get trapped.

Every member of the band delivered on this track - apart from Clemons, who doesn't feature on it. The piano rides the high road above the organ, while the drums and bass seem to just go off where they feel like going. The guitar just builds and builds.

Both 'Incident' and the last track on the second side, 'New York City Serenade', are unashamedly romantic - stories of young love frozen in time.

'Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)' is the track that most fans will know from the album. It was for years the highlight of Springsteen's live show, bringing to the fore the huge saxophone sound of Clarence Clemons. The song never seems to finish .It just gets better and better, higher and higher. The story of a young man's hope of liberating his girl from the curfewed existence in her parent's home was based on Springsteen's own experience.

**BS:** It's a rocker, a dance song. When I was a kid, I had this one girl, I was 17, I had a court injunction put out against me. The mother disliked me a lot, she would call the cops a lot if I came around. At night you would walk by the house, stand under the window...

Considering the lack of "state of the art" equipment at the studio, Springsteen was still able to make this song sound larger than life simply by the sheer energy he injected into it. You can hear what each instrument is doing, and the sound is live and exhilarating. By the end of the track the concert is surely over... except for one last song.

'New York City Serenade' is a perfect example of how, during these sessions, Springsteen was able to pull an extraordinary song out of something quite unremarkable. It came about through fusing together two earlier compositions called 'New York Song' and 'Vibes Man'. Like much of his earlier songwriting they both have a dirge-like quality. Their hybrid child takes it to a whole other level. Beginning with a long, almost classical, introduction by Sancious, with an unmistakable nod to Gershwin, the song settles down into a simple four-chord structure that gently carries you along. Springsteen alternately whispers and sighs in this musical love affair of the New York streets. When the song is finished you have forgotten what you were thinking when you put the needle down.

'New York City Serenade' has been praised and in some cases derided by music critics, but for many Springsteen fans there is something elusively irresistible about it.

**DS:** One of these people got in touch with me to say how much they appreciated the song and my contribution to it. He was saying he was kind of hypnotised by it. He kept on listening to it over and over again.

Sancious indeed played a major role in formulating the piece, and Springsteen gave him the room to do it.

**DS:** Well, you know, it comes from the fact that he wrote a beautiful song. The song itself is not complex, but he did an interesting thing where he sort of dressed up a fairly simple song in an elegant kind of way, like having a classically-orientated acoustic piano. And then the addition of the strings as well, you know. To put that song in the middle of all that texture was a brilliant idea.

I think the producer or the engineer found these three guys, these three violinists who were music-school teachers from the local area. The whole string section was three people who got overdubbed. It wasn't a string section of people. The engineer, Louis Lahav was the first one to turn me on to the technique of doing that with strings. I knew about overdubs but if you don't have access to a whole bunch of string players you can tape three - or four preferably, if you really want to sound big -and you get them to play the entire arrangement about three times.

These guys were lovely, and that was the first string arrangement I had ever written. I've written a few more since then for different people but that was my first opportunity and I was so excited about it. I worked really hard on it and I stayed up all night for several days, and then came the day that we got picked up to go do it. I was triple-checking everything, and I checked the harmony and wrote out the parts by hand. I was just leaving nothing to chance and it really worked beautifully. It had some interesting movement in it. And I also got to conduct them. I wouldn't call it conducting now, you know - these guys didn't need me to keep time but they needed a little bit of direction, I guess, as to where sections were. So I'm standing there conducting these three guys who were the age of the teachers I had in high school, and it was all working so beautifully. I just remember everyone being really, really happy with it, and Bruce was thrilled.

Mike Appel: With Sancious you're dealing with an instrumentalist. And when he does his own thing he becomes more self-absorbed and a little more obscure than if he's forced into a Bruce Springsteen song structure. Then he only has a little bit for himself, a little spotlight for himself to shine, and I have found that there are a few musicians who are extraordinary when they are forced into that situation. It's almost like what Duke Ellington says, you know, "I don't need more time. I need a deadline". So it's like, "Davey, look, we need a little something here, can you help us out?" and then he just listens and doodles a bit and the next thing you know he comes up with an extraordinary thing. You say, "That's it, Davey. You couldn't have done anything better". And nobody could have.

Even though he temporarily halted their subsequent tour to apply finishing touches to the album, Springsteen left the studio and went back out on the road as money was tight and they were ready to promote the album. With Sancious in the line-up, there was an extra component that changed the sound of what was soon to be known as the E Street Band. There was a new fluidity, a jazz sensibility that fitted perfectly with this collection of versatile musicians.

Listening to the few live recordings of the time - from Max's Kansas City, where they were supported for six nights by the original line-up of the Wailers, to Gaston Hall in Georgetown and Liberty Hall in Houston - the band play at their most controlled but also at their most abandoned.

"Hyperactivity was our business", said Springsteen when he later described the energy of the band at the time. Vini Lopez's drumming was, he said "wildly eccentric". When Lopez was forced to quit the band in February 1974 due to an altercation with the management and also possibly due to that eccentricity no longer fitting with where the band was heading, Sancious suggested his friend Ernest "Boom" Carter as a replacement. This made the band even more jazz orientated as Sancious and Carter started throwing all kinds of shapes into the mix.

**DS:** Once Ernest was in the band... it's really a shame that there's not more of him officially recorded, but it really took off, I think. You know the change of drummer, it wasn't comfortable, but Bruce calculated that it was necessary musically and I think he was right. That band, it was really, really something and we were playing a lot and playing long shows. Bruce likes to play a long time, as you know, and there's nothing like getting a band in shape, you know, night after night after night, whether you are sick or well or whatever. There's nothing like... not just whipping a band into shape but having its own nature evolve.

There is no doubt that, over the next year, there wasn't a cooler band in town. Looking at Barry Schneier's photos of the tour, they look like they're at the top of their game. Along with Springsteen's songs they played everything from 'Satin Doll' to 'Walkin' the Dog' to '634-5789'. But it took time for the songs on the album to become fully-fledged live regulars.

'New York City Serenade' became a fixture almost immediately. Often they would begin the concert with it. Sancious would improvise the introduction, sometimes continuing for five minutes before Springsteen cut in, bending notes with his acoustic guitar. The crowd loved it.

**DS:** I mean, it was pretty much complete freedom. Bruce said you can play whatever you like as long as you like, and when you've finished - when you feel you said what you wanted to say - just look up give me a nod and start the song. That's how we always did it live.

'Sandy' and 'The E Street Shuffle' were also put straight into the show, but 'Kitty's Back' and 'Rosalita' did not become permanent parts of the live show until early 1974. For the rest of 1973, 'Thundercrack' fulfilled the role of lifting the crowd towards the end of the show. 'Incident on 57th Street' never really took off live until Suki Lahav, wife of Louis Lahav, joined the band in September 1974. Her violin intro and outro gave it a wistful quality that was present on the album version. This wonderful version can now be heard on the recording of the show at the Main Point in Philadelphia in 1975, released in 2011.

Halfway through 1974, Springsteen played a few gigs at a small club called Charlie's Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Attending one of the shows was journalist and producer, Jon Landau.

**DS:** I remember that night 'cause I complained about the condition of the piano in the place and it was really not nice, it was not a good instrument. It wasn't clean and I was just fed up with playing... you know when you're a guitar player and it's your guitar it doesn't matter how good or bad the club is, it's your personal instrument.

Piano players back in those days didn't have the luxury of having their own thing, so you're at the mercy of various places. As part of the condition of playing there, they rented a brand new Yamaha. It was a seven-foot grand piano, which was like heaven, and I really remember enjoying playing that night. But that show... I think Jon Landau sat on my left-hand side 'cause it was not a huge place so there was no big gulf of space between the band and the audience.

A month later Landau returned to Boston to see Springsteen again. This time he wrote a life-affirming review of the show describing Springsteen as "rock and roll's future". From a position where Springsteen was winning converts, he now found himself having to live up to a messianic expectation that the review stirred up. At the same time, he now knew that the The Wild, the Innocent and the E St Shuffle had shifted few units. Columbia records' policy, as far as new bands on the label were concerned was: "Show us that you can sell records and we'll back you big time, until then you sink or swim." Springsteen was barely treading water. Columbia grudgingly allowed him one last chance. He would have to make an album that would live up to the "Great Prophecy".

In August, Sancious and Carter left the band, having contributed to the first track that Springsteen recorded at 914 Studios for his next album - a song he would then agonise over for the next year. It was called 'Born to Run'.

Sancious had been offered a recording contract and left to form his own band, Tone, taking Carter with him. Over the next few decades Sancious would indeed "break out the guitar", releasing seven albums and playing with all manner of legendary musicians, including Aretha Franklin, Billy Cobham, Stanley Clarke, Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and most notably with Peter Gabriel and Sting.

Gabriel has described him as the "the musician's musician". Gabriel and Springsteen toured together during 1988's Amnesty International tour, when Sancious sat in with the E Street Band occasionally. He reunited briefly with Springsteen in 1992, playing on the Human Touch album.

When Sancious left that August, Springsteen was generous to him, though it must have been a blow at the time.

**DS:** There was never any kind of negative vibe from him. It was nothing to do with not being happy in the situation. It's just that I'd been working on my own music the whole time, always with an aim to do the very same kind of thing that he was doing. And he was the most supportive person in the world, actually. I mean, super-supportive. Even when I got signed to Columbia back then, and I was on the Epic records division of it, he went out of his way to smooth the way for me with certain people. I'm not saying he did anything that dramatic but whatever influence he had to make sure that I was going to have a good time, I think he just quietly did that. It might have just been like, "Hey... he's really a good guy, he deserves, you know, a shot or whatever".

But totally supportive, and I got my first record done. I had a test pressing and I was living in Belmar and he was living in Long Branch. And I got in the car and drove down to his place and we hung out and listened to my whole record. He wanted to hear it and he was really complimentary about all kinds of stuff.

But during his time in the band, Sancious had also given a lot to Springsteen.

Whether or not his presence allowed Springsteen the room to mature musically and lyrically, there is no doubt that - for a short while - he was the catalyst that expanded Springsteen's musical journey.

For Springsteen, however, the agenda changed with the upping of the stakes. He would now be forced to manage his career on a "now-or-never"' basis. No more risks, no more flirting with "carnival sounds" and free-form jazz. Over the next nine months, with a new pianist and drummer, the sound of the band was reined in. The E Street Band became a rock band. Only 'Meeting across the River' on Born to Run has any of the feel of the Sancious days.

The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle became known more as "the album that bombed" and is rarely heralded in its own right as the great album that it is. Sandwiched between two records that deal with their subject matter in a dark monochrome, The Wild... is bursting with colour, characters, humour, abundant musicality and romance. It has been criticised for being under- produced, but that, in a way, is part of its charm. It would be a while before Springsteen would again be caught quite so off-guard, so unselfconscious.

In hindsight it is unlikely that Sancious, Carter, and Lopez would ever have fitted in with Springsteen's subsequent musical journey. They were right for the time, for the moment. Looking at the photo by David Gahr on the back of the album it is easy to get the feel of that moment. This was a summer album and the band have a look on their faces that twenty-year-olds should have when things are going their way. When this interviewer showed Sancious the picture he paused and exhaled. It appeared that he had not seen it in forty years.

**DS:** Well, first of all, I'm barefoot! I remember I used to go round barefoot in summertime. Look at Clarence, we're both barefoot. That was a summer thing.

Gary's got clogs on, and he's kind of barefoot. Danny's the nicest-dressed one in this picture. He looks like he's going to have his photo taken for a record album. The rest of us look like somebody just stopped us and said, "Listen, just stand still".

I remember that day... and look how dark Bruce is, he really got so dark in the summer. We used to tease him like he was becoming Puerto Rican. I mean, he got really dark, he used to tan really well. He used to surf back then, too.

He was really into surfing. I wonder if he still does that. But yeah, I sure remember this picture, man. Wow.

It is probable that, for Springsteen, the surfing days were over. After completing Born to Run, he headed out on the road again, had his picture simultaneously on the front cover of Time and Newsweek and became an international star. They still played 'New York City Serenade', only it never quite sounded the same. But in September 1974 Springsteen was still entranced by the song's indefinable quality:

**BS:** Every time we do it a little differently. I like to do that number when we play. That's forever, you know, it gets that beat, it gets that groove going and it just goes on forever, it's just one of those songs. It hooks up with a rhythm and it just goes on into the night. That song is really special to me, I don't know why. It's hard to talk about. I really can't explain it.
