"What my band and I are about is a sense of responsibility. If you accept it, that makes you responsible for everything that happens. People tend to blame circumstances but in the end it's always your choice."

"On the day Elvis died, the British editors were unusually quiet. The normally would have been jumping all over one another in an effort to control a big story. But the American heartland frightens them."

HAVING EMPLOYED a lethal combustion of tenacity, arch-theatrics and gut-level emotional rapport, Bruce Springsteen left Britain a hero of demi-god proportions. He grabbed hold of the country as if it was a drenched towel and systematically squeezed every drop of seat out of its frayed fibres. Somewhere in the region of a 100,000 people harkened to the phrase "Bruce Saves".

And it was in the national press coverage that you were able to judge the fervour in which he was greeted and the impact he made.

"Springsteen - Rock's Reluctant Millionaire!" blared a headline on the front of the Daily Mirror, and inside they gladly devoted a whole superlative strafed page to "the king of American rock, whose shows send his fans into a frenzy". This was a day before Bruce opened at the Wembley Arena with a stunning act that lasted three hours and caused the hall to shake so much because everybody was dancing that the lighting rig above the band was loosened from its moorings and threatened to crash down on Springsteen and saxophonist Clarence Clemons.

Meanwhile The Sunday Times even dropped their habitually austere, condescending front to print not merely Derek Jewell's drooling rave review, but a substantial profile. This article headlined "A Responsible Rocker", was easily the most articulate study of Springsteen to appear.

WELL, IT'S like Miami Steve says: If you didn't pick up on it the first time round, you've only yourself to blame."

In the coffee bar of the Carlton Towers hotel in Knightsbridge, Dave Marsh chuckles while quoting the E Street Band guitarist's rationale. Marsh, an extremely short, somewhat gaunt midwesterner with cold, piercing eyes, is best known as Bruce Springsteen's biographer, his Born To Run tome traipsing through all the stages of its subject's career with an obsessive lavishness bordering on religious mania.

Once called the Teenage Dwarf when he edited Detroit's Creem magazine in its heyday of the early '70s, Marsh came to ideological blows with the journal's burgeoning 'trash aesthetic' slant, spurning 'the gonzo shift' for a three- piece suit, wedlock and a desk in Rolling Stone's skyscraper offices. The move meant that he aged 20 years overnight - or so it seemed to some of his former colleagues.

Marsh did, however, bridge this leap with a year in Boston working for The Real Paper, the 'alternative' journal that became the model for the film Between The Lines. More crucially, it was this Boston newsheet that first ran the infamous article in 1974 from which Columbia Records tartly plucked the slogan, "I have seen the future of rock 'n' roll and its name is Bruce Springsteen", thus sparking one of the most controversial brouhahas in the history of rock. The piece was penned by Jon Landau, but it was Marsh who edited it, backing Landau to the hilt.

"However you wish to view the pros and cons of that whole 'hype' issue, the fact remains that Columbia was on the point of dropping Bruce from the label straight after E Street Shuffle had initially bombed. Jon and I knowingly interceded with that article. Clive Davis had been ousted and only the press department really believed in Bruce's worth.

"You could say that we were aware of our intentions."

Marsh often seems remarkably smug. He has a tendency to boast of his closeness to and influence with Bruce, and his zealous ardour is always well to the fore when Springsteen's form is being discussed. Certainly Bruce appears to enjoy talking to Marsh because out of some five lengthy interviews that he has given to publicise 'officially' both the release of The River and the formidable 18-month world tour (now half-complete), Marsh was picked to conduct most of the probing. His features were then syndicated and published throughout the world, frequently as "exclusives".

Of course there's nothing unusual in one journalist forming a bond with an artist - except that Bruce Springsteen's personal press relations person is one Barbara Carr, for the last eight years also known legally as Mrs David Marsh.

For a man who takes such expansive pleasure in conversing with his audience when in concert, Bruce Springsteen is reluctant to talk to the press. Several reasons appear obvious: firstly that rock critics impaled him first as another "new Dylan", then conspired - albeit often unwittingly - to belabour him with sufficient superlatives to evoke an equally fierce backlash; secondly, and more pertinently: Springsteen is aware of being unable to express himself with the articulacy he feels he should show. During weighty conversations he tends to become ponderous, self-consciously struggling for just the right word - or phrase - with which to frame his viewpoint. His statements are often uttered haltingly, riddled with "y'knows", "likes" and quasi-neanderthal "uhs".

When asked to pinpoint key changes that success has brought, for example, his eloquence is taxed to its gruff-voiced maximum.

"Well, see, that particular word...success, like, it's all down to what you're aimin' for, I guess. Like, I felt relatively successful when I was just going out and...y'know...playing the clubs around New Jersey. I was 18...19, my folks had just moved to California so...like,...I wasn't attached to a whole bunch of stuff and my responsibilities only involved myself...(pause).

"And the guys in my band, of course.

"It was an easy life, just playing the bars. I had an emotional outlet...y'know...I was...I wasn't exactly satisfied but I generally felt good about what I was doin' even though...(self-conscious chuckle) it was no way big time stuff. Like outside of Asbury Park we...(pause).

"I mean, if you said you came from New Jersey, everyone'd go...(he mimicks a repellant groan of contempt). Like, I didn't know anybody who'd made a record!

Nobody I knew had anything too much. I mean, I didn't know anyone who'd even been as far as Pennsylvania", he laughs. "Everybody - the band and myself - we stayed real close.

"See, for me it was more of a struggle after I became...uh...notorious! I mean, sorta...after the magazines 'n' stuff. Then I felt the struggle. Before I thought I was livin' it up!

"I just figure...it's like if you're gonna make more'n 500 dollars a night, you're gonna have more than just 500 dollar problems. That's all there is to it", he laughs. "Y'know?"

OF THE four weeklies only the staid old Melody Maker has plugged away consistently praising the man's work since Greetings From Asbury Park first showcased his talents. Sounds and Record Mirror have tended either to ignore Springsteen or else afford grudging lip service, while New Musical Express has usually been cautious in its evaluations.

There have been a variety of articles on Springsteen, both praising and damning, but a hostile review of his Madison Square Gardens show and Julie Burchill's negative response to The River created quite a stir in the Springsteen camp. Delicate negotiations between CBS and NME to arrange an interview were abandoned, apparently after Bruce's management made their feelings towards the paper clear. NME most certainly would not have access to Springsteen during his Euro-tour. Only Melody Maker was given any kind of audience whatsoever, Dave Marsh informally checking into the latter's office to establish a relationship that would ultimately land one of the writers a precious 30 minutes informally chatting with "the Boss" backstage in Paris sans cassette recorder.

Ultimately it now appears to have been simply a matter of smart public relations cooked up by Landau and PR Barbara Carr. The deal is straightforward enough: the national press was essentially the area that needed most attention in order to make Bruce Springsteen a household name in Britain. When Richard Williams stated in the Sunday Times that "he (Springsteen) is...indisputably the biggest attraction in the world", Landau and Carr's PR plan had scored bullseye.

The wilful application of such tactics in Britain tended to be carried through without regard for the consequences, especially to Springsteen's own reputation.

"There's not much people can count on today", Springsteen told Rolling Stone last December, unwittingly summarising the basic thrust of his own career-as- personal crusade. "Everything has been so faithless and people have been shown such disrespect. You want to show people that somehow somewhere somebody can...I guess you just don't want to let them down...Mainly it's important to have that passion for living, to somehow get it from someplace."

That Springsteen has chosen rock'n'roll as a vehicle for stressing a gospel of hope, defiance and unity as a tonic against such demoralised times is at once both perfectly obvious and patently ludicrous. Obvious because it commands such a formidable and impressionable audience, and ludicrous because the same audience can no longer define what it is anymore, so fragmented has the form become stylistically that the term itself is redundant.

And it's something to which Springsteen agrees, albeit in his typical halting manner.

"The rock'n'roll thing - the phrase itself - has become so...so unrealistic.

I'm talkin' about the accoutrements", he smirks self-consciously while hoarsely winding his tongue around the syllables. "Not...I mean the 'spirit" is forever out there on the streets but...like...the other stuff is up at some suite at the Hilton. The 'star' stuff - the 'star' system somehow got hooked up with the Hollywood 'star' thing somewhere down the line in a real negative way. Now some people can do it, some can't. The showmanship, the great flamboyance (laughs), that wild outrageousness.

"See, this is one thing I've spent...like...years and years thinking about, I guess, from exactly the time when particular people started offering me those particular things. First, the car...uh, limousine...then the big mansions on the hill. I've always been suspicious of, y'know - the whole package deal and I'm...scared of it. I'm afraid because you just see too many people gettin blown away, gettin' sucked down the drain."

"And Elvis ...boy, he was the ultimate example of that. Here was a guy who had it all y'know and he...lost it or maybe just let it slip through his fingers 'cos somewhere, somehow, he just stopped caring. He let himself get fat and he became a cartoon...a caricature."

Springsteen pauses and then begins to relate key sequences from the biopic This Is Elvis (opening in London shortly but which Springsteen saw previewed several months ago), becoming more animated as he describes early concert footage and then detailing Presley's final filmed appearance several weeks before his death where, bloated and barely coherent, he can only turn the central monologue of 'Are You Lonesome Tonight?' into feeble self-parody.

This declaration of abject redundancy - the artist diminished to feeble buffoon - clearly haunts Springsteen.

"Elvis", he states the name as if evoking some deity, "Elvis...now there-was a real heartbreaker!"
