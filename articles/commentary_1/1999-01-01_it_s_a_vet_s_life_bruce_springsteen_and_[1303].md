It was Springsteen's most epic moment - and his most misunderstood. Phil Sutcliffe uncovers the double life of Born In The USA.

Until Bruce Springsteen took to the road as an acoustic folkie singing about poverty, drugs and human dereliction with the songs from The Ghost Of Tom Joad in 1995, many critics clove to the notion that he was just the grease-monkey bard of cars-and-girls culture. But this was only because they didn't listen and missed nearly everything. They missed how, by 1980, in the emotional life beyond his music, his natural tendency to what he calls "isolation" within himself had taken him to the edge of a void which he was desperate to fill.

His early ventures in self-education were, in part, an attempt to find a solution. The school dunce and drop-out, past 30 already, toiled at literature (crucially, Steinbeck) and forbidding volumes of American history. Then, by chance, he picked up Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic's autobiography, Born On The 4th Of July. No sooner had he read it than he bumped into Kovic in Los Angeles and their conversation led to a heartfelt (and fund-raising) relationship with the Vietnam Veterans Of America organisation. Inspired by the potential for such "community involvement", Springsteen then tied most of his '80s gigs in to publicity and personal donations to local causes ranging from American food banks to the campaigning wives of striking miners in Newcastle upon Tyne. His new perceptions and commitments translated into his songwriting too.

On January 3, 1982, at his rented home in Holmdel, NJ. he recorded more than a dozen songs on a four-track cassette player. When most of them proved intractable to band treatment, he released the demos as a startlingly bleak solo acoustic album, Nebraska. But among the "rejects" - now available on Tracks - was the first draft of 'Born In The USA' (same words, different melody). Out of sorts as they were with their would-be Nebraska sessions, The E Street Band took hold of Born In The USA the moment Springsteen played it to them. The recording which was to change all of their lives erupted from only their second run-through. Weinberg's nuclear snare drum, Bittan's trumpet voluntary of a synthesizer lick, the whole band's great rolling fanfare for the common soldier all came tumbling out in one mighty oceanic wave which rolled on into the unplanned 90 seconds of instrumental outro thundering to fade. Sincerely if not impartially, Jon Landau, Springsteen's manager and co- producer, called it "The most exciting thing that ever happened in a recording studio".

Come June, 1984, when the band album was finally ready, Springsteen says he knew that 'Born In The USA' would be huge, that it meant stadiums, the status of a temporary demigod. And he went for it. As he noted after the album had run its course, "We had that cut and that was kinda sayin', All right, come on! In the end what we did was what we set out to do."

With the title song its imperial signature, Born In The USA bestrode the music world for a year on its way to eventually selling 20 million. Although the muscled-up, headband-toting grunt image Springsteen adopted for the global tour drew obvious comparisons with Sylvester Stallone's cliché Viet vet maverick Rambo, anyone who heard 75,000 at Wembley Stadium or 40,000 at St James's Park singing along with all the verses could only conclude that the mass of fans got it. They heard that 'Born In The USA' roared with pain and a degree of defiance, but not triumph. They understood the story of a dead-end boy from "a dead man's town" opting for Vietnam rather than jail at home, losing his buddy at Khe Sahn, coming home to unemployment and an empty life of "ten years burning down the road/Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go".

The story, Springsteen recalled to Mark Hagen, is that "There's someone returning home and trying to find where they belong, if they belong. The music was martial and powerful, expressing a survivor instinct: I have been through this, I am out the other side, and I am alive."

However, having entered the arena of political comment, Springsteen quickly found that the exposure he craved had a downside. Released in a presidential election year, the song soon became a prime target for partisan opportunism. Conservative columnist George Will took 'Born In The USA' for a gung-ho patriotic anthem, writing that "Springsteen is no whiner and the recitation of closed factories and other problems always seemed punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: Born in the USA!"

Then, in Hammonton, NJ, on September 19, 1984, President Reagan reached out for the youth vote, gravelling, "America's future rests in the message of hope so many young people admire: New Jersey's own Bruce Springsteen".

A few nights later on stage in Pittsburgh Springsteen issued a barbed rebuttal, wondering aloud about Reagan's favourite album: "I don't think it was Nebraska... "

Predictably, this rebuff immediately led to Democratic Party candidate Walter Mondale claiming Springsteen's support. He was forced to apologise that his office had "misinformed" him.

These altercations resolved any doubts music fans might have had about the import of 'Born In The USA'. But the experience of misinterpretation - and its durability: Bob Dole again used the song without permission during his 1996 presidential campaign - never persuaded Springsteen that he should have backed away from the song's lightning-rod energy. "Any work out there is open to different types of interpretation", he says now. "That is part of the roll of the dice. I probably could have made a record that would have been more easily understood, but... that was the right record."

However, the Born In The USA adventure introduced a whole range of uncertainties into his life as an artist and otherwise. "Bruced out", as he put it, he created a great, quiet album, Tunnel Of Love, from the emotional turmoil of his short-lived marriage to Julianne Phillips. Then, disgusted with "the macho thing" and the "iconic role" he had created for himself, he broke away from The E Street Band, divorced, and spent the following year in misery: "I spun off for a while, I just got lost... I was in a lot of fear", he said, confessing that he "made life generally unpleasant" for his new partner, Patti Scialfa.

At that point, he took to therapy and, he believes, gained some insight into the "pure self-loathing" which had produced his painful emotional isolation. But his work did no better than stumble along: Human Touch, Lucky Town, the bizarre "Plugged" MTV album, the unnecessary Greatest Hits were all unsatisfactory.

But eventually he pulled through. Clearly, his relationship with Scialfa deepened - "She has a very sure eye for all of my bullshit" - and he encountered his own "terrifying" capacity to love their three children. Musically, he downsized to 'The Streets Of Philadelphia', The Ghost Of Tom Joad, to playing theatres solo with an acoustic guitar. He still sang 'Born In The USA'. But he cut the chorus which, in 1984, made the world punch the air.
