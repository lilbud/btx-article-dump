They are among the few who really call him boss--both the antics and the musicianship of the E Street Band are a major element in Bruce Springsteen's four-hour marathons. But, thanks to the overwhelming fascination inspired by their leader, the E Streeters are frequently overlooked in all the excitement. Detailed information on them and their history is difficult to find, omitted from the wealth of printed material that has dealt with the Springsteen story and legend. The following is a brief look at this extraordinary ensemble, considered to be one of the best rock and roll bands in history:

**Clarence "Big Man" Clemons, Saxophone**

Is almost as important an emblem of the E Street Band as the Boss. Musically, he's not so important anymore; since the days of "Born to Run" (Springsteen's third album), the emphasis on saxophone in Springsteen's music has gradually diminished. At the same time, Clemons' towering onstage persona as some sort of Springsteenian man-will-endure symbol has skyrocketed to the point where onstage nicknames such as"king of the world" and "master of the universe" are less and less ironic. He always has figured prominently in Springsteen's rambling stories, and, beginning with the "Born in the U.S.A." tour slightly over a year ago, Springsteen has taken to climaxing renditions of "Thunder Road" by sailing across the stage and implanting a huge kiss on Clemons' lips. ("It just seemed the thing to do", Springsteen has said by way of explanation.) Clemons has his own group, the Red Bank Rockers, and has been more visible lately, thanks partly to a couple of appearances on David Letterman's late night television talk show.

**Roy Bittan, Piano**

Came on board right before "Born to Run", replacing David Sancious. A flashy and deft keyboard artist with both rock and roll and Broadway roots, Bittan quickly became a key component of the Springsteen sound as well as a powerful concert performer. (His reworked live solos for "Kitty's Back", a jazzy classic from Springsteen's second album, have a unique and exciting sound all their own.) In the same way that Springsteen's music has moved away from the saxophone, the piano seems less important on later albums, including "Born in the U.S.A." But Bittan's magic fingers always get a rippling workout at any Springsteen concert.

**Garry Tallent, Bass Guitar**

First teamed up with Springsteen in 1971, when the group was holding rehearsals in a garage. Quiet, stable and almost always onstage, he lends a solid, technically accomplished sound to the band, competent but not flashy. With Clemons, he is the only current band member to have played on all seven Boss albums and is somewhat renowned for his passion for Buddy Holly and his co-ownership of reputedly the largest rhythm and blues record collection on the East Coast.

**Patti Scialfa, Vocalist**

Enjoys the distinction of being the first woman to break the once all-male bastion of the E Street Band, joining the group at the beginning of the "Born in the U.S.A." tour. Critics complained at first that Springsteen didn't seem to know how to use his new singer, but there was good reason--she was selected only days before the beginning of the tour. Like Springsteen, Scialfa is from New Jersey; earlier jobs included stints with Southside Johnny Lyon, a Jersey shore performer whom Springsteen has turned into a cult figure.

**Nils Lofgren, guitar**

Didn't join the E Street Band until the beginning of the "Born in the U.S.A." tour. His was one of the more coveted as well as thankless tasks in rock history--to replace longtime Springsteen guitarist and alter ego, "Miami" Steve Van Zandt, who left more than a year ago to form his own band. Still, observers felt that if Van Zandt had to go, Lofgren was an ideal choice. Long underappreciated, the talented guitarist was responsible for a string of critically admired, commercially unsuccessful albums, first with a short-lived band called Grin and later as a solo artist. (He also played with Neil Young's Crazy Horse band.) Since becoming an E Streeter, Lofgren's onstage guitar work has been both accomplished and admired. Vocally, however, he can't match Van Zandt's high-pitched duets with Springsteen, one reason Scialfa was added on at the last minute.

**Danny Federici, keyboards**

Has played with Springsteen on and off for 15 years, a member of the Boss' now-legendary heavy metal band, Steel Mill. He did not, however, show up on the albums until "Born to Run", legendarily agreeing to participate in that venture "in order to pay the rent." His is an extremely low profile in a low profile group.

**"Mighty" Max Weinberg, Drums**

Came on with the "Born to Run" album, replacing Vini "Mad Dog" Lopez. One of the most respected drummers in the business, Weinberg brought a stable sound to the band and then went on to be an early pioneer of a new, powerful, driving drumbeat. His 1984 collection of interviews with great drummers ("The Big Beat", co-authored with Robert Santelli), included conversations with the likes of Ringo Starr, Charlie Watts and Dave Clark and is generally regarded as a long-overdue focus on the contributions of the least celebrated sidemen of rock and roll.
