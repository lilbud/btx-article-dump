Bruce Springsteen reaffirmed the remarkable bond between him and his fans

Is there any sound in popular music that is more exhilarating, more joyful, more uplifting, more life-affirming than that of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in full flight? I don't think so. Having been one of the lucky witnesses of this, the only UK date on Springsteen's tour of Europe, I feel able to reiterate what has been said so many times by so many people (and by me): that when it comes to live performance, no one can touch Bruce and his buddies. They played their hearts out, sang their hearts out, gave their all, the band producing a triumphant display of ensemble musicianship while Bruce reaffirmed the remarkable bond that exists between him and his fans. In short, it was sensational.

Apart from all the usual things that make a night with Bruce Springsteen so memorable - the drama, the passion, the noise from the crowd, the almost palpable waves of affection that cascaded on to the stage, Born to Run, Badlands, Thunder Road, Clarence Clemons's saxophone solos - what was remarkable about this show was that so many of the songs from his recent The Rising album fitted so comfortably into the scheme of things; the redemptive Waitin' on a Sunny Day and the exuberant Mary's Place, for instance, had the fans singing along as if they had been part of his repertoire for decades. The addition of a violinist, meanwhile, gave the music an extra dimension, a note of plangency floating above the exquisitely warm, rich, bright wall of sound being produced by the rest of the band. As for Bruce himself, I doubt there has ever been a more authentic, emotionally honest performer. From the very first song, the title track from the new album, he was possessed by the spirit of music, his face contorted with emotion, his voice crackling (but not cracking), his sinews straining. At its best, live music can make you feel that you have been on a journey, and Bruce took us on an epic trip lasting almost three hours, from the sombre depths of September 11-inspired songs such as Into the Fire and the militant "prayer for peace", Born in the USA, to the unfettered, reckless joy of Born to Run. And at the end of this cynicism-stripping journey, when many of us would have been happy to go round again, he said just the words we wanted to hear: "See you in springtime."
