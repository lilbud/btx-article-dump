Ladies and gentleman, the Very Reverend Bruce Springsteen and E Street Band delivered the champagne in a sparkling, four-hour sermon of top-flight, gospel-charged soul in their last Australian concert for 2014 at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre on Wednesday.

It finished at 11.55pm after Springsteen delivered a touching, clear version of Thunder Road alone with his acoustic guitar.

"Australia, the E-Street Band loves you", the still fit, gritty-voiced singer said.

"But we'll be back", he said, walking slowly off stage after delivering a staggering 30-song set which took the audience from the Bee Gees' Redcliffe, through the heart of New York circa 1974, back to modern times and then out through AC/DC's Highway to Hell.

It started at 8.05pm with Bruce thanking his Australian fans before teasing his way into the set, with the cover song that he identified most with each capital city.

It was the Bee Gees' turn in the city last night.

Their disco hit Stayin' Alive became a Motown monster groove that had the E Street Band horn section taking solos straight up.

They then punched through three songs from their 1973 debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park: It's Hard to be a Saint in the City, Does this Bus Stop at 82nd Street and Growin' Up.

Here Springsteen reminisced about his super-heroes; The Flash, the Human Torch and Batman.

Springsteen remains legendarily close to his fans, again on Wednesday night letting them dance with him, play his acoustic guitar, sing with him, crowd- surf him back to the stage, hug him and kiss him.

At one stage - after again being crowd-surfed back to the stage, he tells the crowd he has found someone's cell phone in his back pocket.

"That's a first, I didn't feel a thing!"

He fumbles to get it to work.

He in turn confides in them, his light-hearted weaknesses to new technology.

"I'm a late converter, I'm still working out my iPhone", he says drawing laughs.

The band kicked into Spirit in the Night, again from Asbury Park, after Springsteen mock-pleaded with the crowd like a malicious preacher.

"How do you stay alive?" he pleaded, "Can you feel the spirit?"

"Can you feel it right now?"

Wham. Ladies and gentleman Reverend Bruce was back in the house!

Down went the overdrive pedal.

High Hopes, the title track from his latest album, was followed by his second nod to Brisbane, the soul-charged version of The Saints' Just Like Fire Would, where the E-Street Band locked into the song's horn line like they owned it.

Then Springsteen picked songs to play from the signs held by the audience, holding up the sign to the E-Street Band and counting in the songs.

That's when you know the band is good.

One, two, three bam!

We got scorching versions of You Can Look, (But You Better Not Touch) and Sherry Darling from The River, before the quieter Save My Love, originally recorded for Darkness on the Edge of Town album, but released years later.

"It's pretty obscure. It was just too happy to get on that album", he laughed.

Then they play guitarist Stevie Van Zandt's favourite song, Fade Away, a mid- tempo pessimistic tune recorded for The River, which Springsteen jokes he had to play for Little Stevie once every tour.

Springsteen and Van Zandt have a ball together on stage, singing, joking, pulling faces, a change from last year's Australian tour when Van Zandt was filming his television show, Lilyhammer, in Norway.

But by this time the crowd had taken over and Bruce is asking for requests.

The outcome, the seven songs from their second album, The Wild, the Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle, that was released in 1973 and shook world music with its funky soulful jazz and street blues sound.

From the opener, E-Street Shuffle, to the gorgeous closing track, New York City Serenade, each E-Street Band member absolutely shone, with Springsteen excelling on guitar parts that helped shape his career, and Roy Bittan influential in absolutely everything on keyboards.

Jake Clemons, played the sax parts his uncle, Clarence Clemons, famously played in 1973, following The Boss through the audience.

This is the sound that Springsteen and the early E-Street Band eventually took to the world.

On Wednesday night the E-Street band took Brisbane a step back to New Jersey 1973-74 to see where it all started.

While for most, it was a splendour to see, Springsteen seemed to understand some in the crowd may have been left behind, becoming fans after this album.

Out came the crowd favourites; Darlington County, Waiting on a Sunny Day \- where one young boy sang solo on stage, a stirring emphatic version of The Rising, before The Ghost of Tom Joad and Badlands.

Last year, guest guitarist Tom Morello, from Rage Against the Machine, was a sensation in Tom Joad, sharing the vocals with Bruce and playing a solo that started in conventional blues, went to contemporary sound effects and back again.

Again, his popping, wailing, solo had people turning their heads on Wednesday night producing big grins from guitarists Nils Lofgren, Stevie Van Zandt and Springsteen himself.

Badlands just swaggered with rude intent, Glory Days sounded like the radio gem it is, and Born to Run remains the perfectly constructed rock song, with the sax solo and the descending run in the middle simply anthemic.

There the show went to Bobby Jean (from Born in the USA), then Dancing in the Dark - when it seemed a dozen people from the crowd were invited up to dance, play guitar and sing - before the sexy Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.

Here Bruce went through the crowd one last time, while the big screens played a tribute to the late E-Street Band sax man Clarence Clemons overhead.

And then there was Eddie Vedder.

The E-Street Band absolutely crunched AC/DC's Highway to Hell, with the Pearl Jam frontman just loving his time punching out the vocals, while each of the four guitarists; Lofgren, Morello, Van Zandt and Bruce had their shake at Angus Young's famous guitar break.

It was stage magic, but suddenly that magic was over.

And just before the stroke of midnight, Bruce returned alone to thank Australian audiences, to talk a little about our surfing beaches.

And to drive down our Thunder Road.

"Don't tell anybody about this shit you've got down here OK? People will start coming.

"Good night."

I can't tell you how it compared to Bruce's concerts of the 1980s, but if you thought 2013 was great, 2014 went the step beyond.
