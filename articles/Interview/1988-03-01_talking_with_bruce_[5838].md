WORCESTER - A very relaxed Bruce Springsteen sat in his dressing room, propped his black-booted feet on a table, threw back his arms and began explaining why his latest tour is such a radical departure from the anthem-laden, greatest-hits approach of 1985's "Born in the U.S.A." venture.

"I just felt if I'm going to go out and play today, I'd have to drop all the cornerstones of my shows", Springsteen said well after midnight following his Sunday concert.

"That's the first thing. I felt like I had to. It's not that I'll never play those songs again. I'm sure I will. But when I went to put this show together, I said, 'Well, what were the songs that were the cornerstones of what I had done?' And most of those were the ones I automatically put to the side."

The current tour, which finished its three-day opening run at the Worcester Centrum last night, features seven songs from his new "Tunnel of Love" album and a host of lesser-known tracks, including four B-sides from singles. Dropped from the set are such Springsteen standards as "Badlands" and "Thunder Road" -- two songs that defined his street-savvy image of a decade ago.

"It was important to just give that stuff a rest", he said during a joint interview with this writer and Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times. "To come out and kick through it again didn't make any sense. To dig back is what we did on the 'Born in the U.S.A.' tour. So I wanted something very different."

Springsteen, whose wife Julianne sat on a couch next to him during the conversation, also made it plain he doesn't want to be embalmed by his past.

"You move on; you change. You're not the same person you were", said the 38-year-old singer. "You can't come out and play oldies, because then you're a damned oldies act. You just can't come out and try to push people's buttons with old songs. It's a waste of time -- a waste of my time and a waste of their time. I wasn't interested in coming out and being nostalgic, which you can do even after just one successful tour."

Looking back, Springsteen realized he had outgrown himself.

"Basically, the way we've toured every time since we started is that the show grew and grew and grew -- and every tour we added new songs to the old songs.

And that felt completely natural. But then on the last tour, it did not feel natural. It felt a little embarrassing."

Many of Springsteen's older songs were captured definitively on his concert album, "Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band -- Live: 1975-1985", released two years ago. He recalled how he and his band listened to tapes of those songs, knowing that a new page was about to be turned.

"We said, 'Well, that's that.' That's what happened to that kid between '75 and '85. That's what we did at that time and it seemed worthwhile. We all kind of sat there and sensed that was the end of something and the next time would be different."

Reports circulated that Springsteen would not only change his approach for the new tour, but also leave his band home and perform solo. He confessed to having long talks with manager Jon Landau about bringing an acoustic tour to small halls with 3,000 seats, but finally nixed the idea. "I just didn't think an acoustic show would be physical enough", he said.

But even though the E Street is back on tour, there are shifts within the group that have confused some fans. Most obvious is that saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who used to be virtually co-billed with Springsteen in earlier days, is playing much less sax because of the softer, guitar/keyboard slant of the "Tunnel of Love" material. Instead he often just plays low-key percussion on stage. On the other hand, backup singer Patty Scialfa is far more prominent than before, often harmonizing side by side with Springsteen.

"I just think you got to go where the particular music is taking you at the time", Springsteen said. "But the continuity of the band is something that's really important to me. When you've got a band that's our size -- and when you're changing your sound -- people are always going to do more and less at different times on different tours. That's just where it's at and how it's gonna work out. The main job is that we are a band; and the idea of a band is to get up on stage and play in an integrated fashion as a unit. There's not a lot of solos. The song is the thing -- get that across and arrange the music so that happens."

Another change concerns the increased theatrics of the tour. Springsteen and his band start by picking up mock-tickets at a carnival booth marked "Tunnel of Love Express Tour." And later, he and Clemons, in a touch of cabaret, sit on a park bench thinking of the girls they once watched in days of innocence on the New Jersey shore.

"We've always done a little theater, though we didn't do it quite as obviously as sitting on a park bench or taking tickets at a booth. But me and Clarence were always doing bits, and these new ones just seemed a natural extension"he said.

There's also a humorous parody of television evangelists, as he struts around and mimics Jimmy Swaggart and Pat Robertson. But no one should read too much into it, Springsteen said. "It's just something I had fun with. That's all."

The chief purpose of the tour is to back the "Tunnel of Love" album, which he considers "absolutely one of my best records." It contains, he admitted, some songs left over from the acoustic music written for his "Nebraska" album in 1982.

"This is more electrified, but it's still not a big rock thing. This feels like the kind of record I want to make now because I don't want to get caught up in that ('Born in the U.S.A.') merry-go-round", he said.

As for the writing of "Tunnel of Love", which has to do with mature romantic conflicts, not the born-to-run mania of his youth, Springsteen said: "I didn't start out with something that was particularly autobiographical. Some songs are stories; some are more a part of my life. The main thing I try to do is find real people in songs. You have to make them live and make them be -- and then you have a song."

Speaking of songwriting, Springsteen said it's a much easier process for him today. Recalling how he originally wrote 35 pages of lyrics for his 1975 hit, "Born to Run", he said, "I don't worry so much about the way things get put together. It used to be a lot harder, but it no longer is. And I really don't know why that is. I'm probably not as restrictive about the things I want to write about. I'm just more open. I used to sweat, really, because I'd have a specific idea and I wouldn't be able to be satisfied. I used to sometimes take six months before I'd have it. It takes about a week now."

Nor does he worry as much about whether his albums will sell in huge quantities. "The first thing you've got to stop worrying about is how much your record is going to sell. If it starts to sell less, then that's OK. It's still the record I wanted to make.

"My main concern with 'Tunnel of Love' was this: I want to make the best record I can, and I want to help that record find its audience. I don't care if it sells this many or that many. There are people out there who would like to hear it and would get something of value out of it. And I want to make sure that happens."
