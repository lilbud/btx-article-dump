Little Steven Van Zandt has been more of a diplomat than a musician in the past six months. In support of his anti-apartheid song, "Sun City", he has crisscrossed the country many times, meeting with ambassadors in the United Nations, mayors in Atlanta and Los Angeles, congressmen and senators in Washington, school children in Chicago and religious leaders from around the world, including the South African bishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Desmond Tutu.

But Van Zandt's whirlwind diplomacy is finally tapering off.

"It's not the kind of thing I'm going to leave fully behind until South Africa is free, but it's not going to be 100 percent of my life. There are other things that need attention", he says, referring to his next solo album. "It's pretty much over now as far as the 'Sun City' record and the whole project is concerned."

Van Zandt's visit to Boston's Metro Wednesday, during which he'll speak but not perform at a Free South Africa Day concert starring locals Down Avenue, Skin, the I-Tones and New Man, will be his last purely "Sun City"-related travel stop.

"This event in Boston is kind of the official end to it; and it's appropriate because Boston was the first place we went", he says, recalling an October visit when he brought the newly-minted "Sun City" single, which included vocals by Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Gil Scott-Heron, to be premiered over Boston radio station WBCN. The song denounced the segregated, Las Vegas-like Sun City resort in South Africa and was followed by an album, book and video cassette featuring interviews with Springsteen and protest leader Winnie Mandela.

"It's been a really good thing, so I don't have any regrets whatsoever about the project", Van Zandt added during a recent phone interview from Los Angeles, where he's also helping produce an album by the country-rock band Lone Justice.

But no regrets? Even though the "Sun City" record was profusely praised by the press yet received spotty airplay and only went to No. 39 on the Billboard pop charts, contrasted to the "We are the World" antifamine single that entered the charts at No. 20 and shot right into the Top 10?

"When somebody doesn't want to play a record, that's up to them. That's what a free society is all about", he says of radio's checkered response to his funk- based song. "I understand radio feels it has to draw lines and subscribe to rigid categorizations. But I really didn't go into this thinking the record would be played in America at all."

Van Zandt was right in expecting a better response in the more socially- aware European countries, where "Sun City" jumped into every nation's Top Ten. In all, the single has sold a half-million copies (six times fewer than "We Are the World").

"From a commercial point of view, the sales were disappointing compared to 'We Are the World', " says his press liaison, Danny Schecter. "But you have to remember that 'Sun City' criticized Ronald Reagan by name and mentioned a place no one knew about. It did pretty well considering all that."

Another success was that the single was circulated in South Africa, where the government was afraid to ban it because they reportedly didn't want to alienate white youths who wanted to hear Springsteen, who also had the No. 2 album in the country at the time. And above all, no major entertainer has since played at Sun City, whose owners have been so desperate they recently consented to allow black South African bands to perform there, but were unanimously turned down by them as well.
