I'm Mark Parenteau, oops, look, the star line is ringing here at 104, ah, let's click in and see who's there, hello?

Bruce: Eh, how ya doing?

Mark: Hi, uh, who's this? We just sort of picked up on there phone here Bruce: It's Bruce, Bruce.

Mark: Bruce Springsteen. How are you buddy? How you feeling this morning?

Bruce: Petty good, pretty good.

Mark: Yeah, I hear, boy I hear it is was gang-busters last night at the Garden Bruce: Yeah, yeah, it was a lot of fun

Mark: Yeah, I hear you had them dancing in the aisles. How you feeling? You've been a busy guy, man - live broadcasts and just everywhere Bruce: Yeah, it's been nice, it's been really uh, this is the last leg of the tour, you know, this is out last like, 4 or 5 shows, you know

Mark: Yeah Bruce: And everybody's sort of, rather than getting more tired, everybody sorta got, sorta woke up again, you know, and the band's playing real good and we had uh, had a lot of fun down in Jersey, you know where we did the broadcast from

Mark: Yeah, we carried that on the air. It sounded just great, sounded like you were having lots of fun on stage Bruce: Yeah, that was the first time we'd been back home in about, oh about a year and 1/2

Mark: Oh man, a year and a 1/2 Bruce: Except for like, you know, a week or so, here and there, you know

Mark: So, are you going to get to take a little vacation time, and uh, get back to laying in the sun for a while?

Bruce: Oh, I got about, let's see, I got 3 more shows and then I got about uh, 4 weeks off, 3 weeks, 3, 3 weeks off and then we're gonna, start in again November 1st and go to New Year's, you know

Mark: Oh man Bruce: So

Mark: That must be hard, day after day, every day, a new city, wake up in a hotel room Bruce: I like doing it, you know, it's like uh, some people I guess, that (?) kind of life really, you know (coughs), like I don't have, I don't have like, I'm not, I'm not married, I don't have a lot at home or nothing, you know, so, and uh, ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to travel around, you know, there's no way that I ever would have been able to travel around if I hadn't, you know, if I hadn't played or if I hadn't been playing, you know

Mark: Yeah Bruce: So, like eh, usually, a lot of times if I get a chance to go home, I don't, I just go on to the next city or something

Mark: Yeah. Bob Seger was here the other day, he did the same thing, instead of going home, he just hung out here in Boston for a day and went on to do more Bruce: Yeah, you get use to it, you know, it's like what happens, is like, you're used to staying in hotels or the motels, like when you go home like, you got no air conditioning (chuckles) or nobody makes your bed (chuckles) (Mark laughs), or you're like, like nobody uh

Mark: Yeah, yeah, a lot of people are like that, the guys on the road get real tired of the road, they want to go home, and they want to get, when they get home, they're so bored that they want to go back out on the road again Bruce: Yeah, that happened to me last time. I went home. I stayed home for about, 3 days and then I got in a plane, I went some place, you know, it was like, I went for about a week, came back, it takes a while to, you know, after you've been out or so long, we've been out since, May sometime, it uh, it's hard to wind down, to like, you know, sittin' around at home or, you know

Mark: When do you write songs? What's, what's the best frame of mind for you when you write songs? Is it airplanes, hotel rooms or a day off?

Bruce: I sorta write songs, like, it's like, it's very similar to, like when do you raid the refrigerator, you know, (chuckles), it's like, when you're hungry or something, you know, or like, could be in the middle of the night or it could be, could be anytime, like, it's sort of, it's like uh, it's just a feeling you get, you know, like uh, the closest thing is like if you get hungry for food or you get, you know, it's like uh, some sort of thing

Mark: This comes over you all of a sudden Bruce: Yeah, you go to, and you pick up the guitar, and like, something comes to you or like uh, we've been doing this new song, Point Blank, which I just wrote it, like a rehearsal one day, no, I wrote it at a soundcheck, matter of fact, I think it was uh, I think it was here in, at the Music Hall

Mark: Great Bruce: You know, where like, it was before uhMark: Last year you were here like uh, 5 nights or something Bruce: Yeah, we played, like I forget, didn't we play here at the beginning of the tour, which doesn't seem that long ago now, it seems like we were just here and played about, played, you know, 3 nights there, and uh, it was during one of the soundchecks that I came up with the music and stuff, during the tour I wrote the rest of the words and stuff, so, it sort of happens anytime, you know, there's no real, I don't have the discipline too much to sit down

Mark: Yeah Bruce: And a lot of times, it doesn't work if you try to force yourself thru it

Mark: Do you think the uh, space in time between uh, Born To Run and Darkness On The Edge Of Town was uh, a hindrance or that it helped uh, you know, build up the anticipation of more Springsteen music or how do you view that intense, I know you were involved in a whole lot of legal weirdness during that time?

Bruce: You know, it was like, it was good and it was bad, you know, it was like, it was good because I had a lot of time to sit around and straighten out the things that had been bothering me, not just legally and all that, you know, and all that mess but

Mark: Like in your life too?

Bruce: But just my, just myself, I had a chance to put all that stuff in perspective, like all that big promotion and stuff, you know, all that uh, all that stuff that went down at that time, and, and uhMark: But it's like Bruce: It just gave me a chance to uh, to get, to get that stuff, you know, where it should be and

Mark: What Bruce: It really, I don't think, you know, it was like, you know, in a way it irks that we were out of, you know, we were out of commission for like 2 years, however long it was, you know, and uh, but in a way, it was like uh, it was good for me, you know, like it was a good thing like that, it was good for me because, you know, I got to write the songs I wanted to write and I had some time and I got (?) all my stuff straight, you know, like if I was gonna go on and maintain my sanity (laughs) I had to get, you know, I had to get straight one way or another you know

Mark: People said there was uh, I don't know if this is fact or fancy that there was a lot of material that you wrote during that period but because you weren't in, in recording and putting out records that it sorta got shelved. Is that true?

Bruce: Yeah, that's, that's true, like uh, I wrote, when we went in to do Darkness, I had already written 13 songs, uh, out of which, you know, very few of them made it on the record, so there was sort of like, a missing album at least, you know

Mark: Yeah Bruce: And uh, you know, so, that was, that was, that was a problem, you know that was a problem

Mark: Do you, do you have any ambitions of like uh, going into television or movies?

Bruce: Aw, not right now, you know, nothing like that

Mark: 'Cause they say you look like Al Pacino, you know, on the cover of the new album Bruce: Oh, everybody, it's funny, I was, I was telling a story for a while, you know, where like, I was sitting in uh, we'd just played in New York and I was sitting in this restaurant, you know, and I'm sittin' there and I see this guy looking at me, you know, and I say 'Oh"

Mark: Uh oh Bruce: Be recognized, you know (chuckles), and like, you know, so, like I'm sittin' there and I trying to, trying to act cool like I don't notice, you know, and the guy comes up to me and, he comes up real slow and he sticks out his hand and like I'm trying to be, you know, real

Mark: Cool?

Bruce: Cool (?) right, he says (Bruce does the guy), 'AL PACINO!' (laughs), 'Hey, how ya doing?, you know, I said 'Naw, no"

Mark: No, Bruce Springsteen, (Mark does the guy) 'No, you're not, you're Al Pacino.

Bruce: You know, it was like, it was funny

Mark: How do you like playing the big halls? Now, I noticed, I know all the times that I've seen you, and I've seen you a bunch of times in New York and around here in Boston. You've always, always played the 5 and 6,000 seaters, and now, you've gone to like, the 10 and 12 and 15, which is great 'cause it accomodates more fans but I was wondering if, how, uh, musically you feel about some of those halls.

Bruce: Well, it's funny, it's like, and the toughest one is, and I'll be honest with you, the toughest, the toughest one is the Boston Garden

Mark: It's an old uh, clunker, isn't it?

Bruce: And, 'cause I had, I had played there in 1973Mark: Right Bruce: Opened up for Chicago thereMark: That's right Bruce: And I remembered the place, I remember, I said 'Oh.' It was the two things I remember about it was that it was old

Mark: It smelled bad Bruce: Big, you know (chuckles), but we, we had played like, other big places on the tour and well, like we knew like the uh, right amount of sound to bring in and we knew, you know, how to cover it and like we had some of our best shows in, in, in the bigger places, you know, all the shows we did at the Garden, they went over, you know, we had a great time there and like all the shows, the shows in Philly and Cleveland and stuff so, what happened yesterday was when I got there, I started to walk around, so, I walked all, all around the building and I realized that, that the, that building has like unique, you know, problems that are unique to itself, you know

Mark: Right Bruce: And that it's made for the action to be right in the middle of the floor, you know, like it's for boxing, or for whatev.., for hockey, whatev..., it's made for the action to be centered, the middle of the floor, soon as you stick something down at one end, you know, 'cause like the overhanging balconies and the way, it's, it's not only a sight problem, it's a sound problem, you know, so I was like really, I was pretty worried there, you know, and I went backstage and I was grumpin' all around and stuff, you know, and then, about 20 minutes before we went on, I started to hear everybody screamin' out front, you know, it's like, I didn't know if was like (?) for the frisbees or something you know, but it sounded like, it just sounded like a really, sounded like a great crowd, like before we went out

Mark: Yeah, they were hot last night Bruce; Yeah, you know, and then we went out there, like the crowd, this is why, really why I wanted, wanted to call is because, is 'cause the kids that were there last night, the people that were there last night, like made me and the whole band feel so comfortable, you know

Mark: Great Bruce: That, it was like, it just, it just turned into a great night, you know, and I was feeling great, you know, and it was something where like it was really, it was just, it was, you know all the kids, all those people there, it was really like a nice, as if, they're really warm, you know, nice, great crowd, and like

Mark: That's a nice thank you to Boston, Bruce Bruce: Well, it really was, and it's like, you know, 'cause the first thing I said (?), you know, call somebody, you know, tell them how great it was, because I was a little nervous and like everybody, we were a little worried but we went out there, and it was like, it just made everybody feel so at ease and stuff that and it was nice because I think it was, a funny thing about the place, you know, it was that, it's a little, you know, it's got, it's got that, it's got that little low, low rent kind of ceiling to it ((chuckles)

Mark: It sure does Bruce: It's a little more of, uh, you know, a little more of a rock 'n' roll feeling to it in a funny, you know, in a funny kind of way

Mark: Well, you got prepped, you know, Bob Dylan was here last Wednesday and then two nights with Seger and then yourself, so the place was all warmed up and ready for you Bruce: Yeah, they were like, they were really ready, and they, I just wanna, you know, I just wanna thank everybody and I wanna, especially the kids, there was a lot of kids, send stuff backstage that I don't have a chance to say 'thank you' for it, they send all the cakes and all sorts of stuff

Mark: Thank you, Bruce, that's real nice, I know when you, a lot of guys when they get to your level of stardom, you know, quote unquote, they really don't have to really do any radio calls or anything because your records will sell anyway and we sure appreciate it because it makes you seem, it makes you real human, you know?

Bruce: You know, that's me, a real human! (cracks up laughing)

Mark: Will you do me a big favor?

Bruce: Sure, what can I do for you? (still laughing some)

Mark: WBCN is having it's, we're 10 years on the air. I know you're familiar with the station from years past but I'll just get out of the way here for a second if you could say, 'Hi, this is Bruce Springsteen and you're listening to uh, 10 years of continuous hot music' or something like that on BCN, I'd appreciate it, and we'll tape it and play it over and over again Bruce: Oh, wow, I, I don't, I don't know, I don't, you know, you should (nervously laughs), uh

Mark: No?

Bruce: I feel a little funny, yeah.

Mark: Okay (laughs) Bruce: I never(?) good at text stuff (still a nervous laugh)

Mark: Okay Bruce:Alright? (still a nervous laugh)

Mark: Then never mind Bruce: But uh, really again, I want to thank you guys and I want to thank, you know WBCN has been great, you know, has been great to me, and uh, I just want to thank you very much and uh, thank all the kids that were at the show last night, because they really, I was a little worried, they really turned it into, like, you know, a great night for us, so

Mark: Bruce, thank you, where is it off to tonight?

Bruce: Okay, thanks a lot

Mark: Okay Bruce Bye-bye

Mark: I'll see you
