They always said he should get out more and now he has. With a lush photo- book, a cherry-plucking anthology LP, a tour with the E Street Band: it's all go chez Bruce Springsteen, soon to be 50 years young. "I was in the mood", he tells Mark Blake.

Bruce Springsteen is remembering the stresses of youth: "Back then, you're all like...er", he trails off, struggling to find the words to express himself, "you're all, like, caught up in this pressure to look a certain way, to act a certain way, to be something." The huskily familiar New Jerseyite voice scrambles around trying to make a point. Briefly, this 49-year-old multi- millionaire - arguably one of rock'n'roll's most iconic performers - sounds every inch the shy, inarticulate, causeless rebel of one of his early songs.

Finding his feet again, Springsteen chuckles warmly and finishes up: "When you get older, though, it's like...aaah, what the hell..."

This shoulder-shrugging statement partly explains the publication of Songs, the book of his 25-year career, comprising original lyrics, previously unseen photographs and comments by the man himself. Closely following the Tracks box set, which scoured the vaults for previously unheard material, and which reappears in April in scaled-down form as 18 Tracks, Songs is yet another revealing project that contradicts the popular notion of Springsteen as rock'n'roll's most private artist.

In an equally unexpected move, he's just announced the re-formation of the E Street Band and an accompanying world tour, including British dates in May.

Flitting between the folk noir of his last solo record, The Ghost of Tom Joad, and the crowd-thrilling nostalgia trail in the blink of an eye, the supposedly stolid Springsteen is suddenly pulling a string of surprises.

**Mark Blake:** Why have you chosen to work with the E Street Band again after all this time?

**Bruce Springsteen:** It's been twenty-five years since we started and it felt right. After The Ghost of Tom Joad I was in the mood to do some loud music again (laughs). I had a couple of new records I was working on that were a mix of acoustic and electric tracks and as soon as I began on the electric tracks I realized that I wanted to play in a band again and that I wanted it to be that particular band.

**MB:**Some of the group seemed aggrieved that you'd dropped them in the first place. Did it end as badly as it looked?

**BS:** I admit it was a funny sort of ending. It was reported at the time as being a break-up. All that happened was that I made a decision to work with other musicians. We were all in our late-thirties and we'd spent all of our adult lives as part of this gang. We were all so deeply, deeply connected with one another and each other's lives and it was time for a change. I made some phone calls and said, Look, I want to take a break from this, but a few years down the line, who knows? That's all that happened.

**MB:** Are you older and wiser now?

**BS:** Older, sure. I don't know...I think the break had a different effect on everybody. I spoke to the guys over the years and they all admitted that it gave them a chance to discover new things - Steve [Van Zandt, guitar] got into acting, Garry [Tallent, bass] went to Nashville to produce records, Max [Weinberg, drums] became a bandleader and went into TV.

**MB:** Are you tired of playing Born to Run yet?

**BS:** That's the nice thing about not having played it in a while (laughs). We've been rehearsing for almost a month now and it's actually quite enjoyable to be playing some of those old songs again. We haven't even settled on a set list yet, but we've been running through stuff off the very first record right up to Tom Joad. We just have to find a way to make everything work with the band.

**MB:** Last year's Tracks boxed set, now the Songs book: why the sudden urge to bare all?

**BS:** After Tom Joad I just wanted to spend some time re-presenting a large body of my work. Tracks was a big part of that, reappraising things I'd done as far back as when I started out - making some of this lost music available. The Songs book is a part of that and so, I guess, is the tour. Twenty-five years on I want to re-connect with the audience that has sustained me since I was very young. Back then you're very concerned with presenting yourself a certain way. Years later, the pressure's not there and it doesn't need to be so private any more.

**MB:** Are there photographs in the Songs book that you wish you could have kept private?

**BS:** Yeah (laughs). I was embarrassed by some of them. I was going through the pictures at the same time as I was choosing material for Tracks and it was a very strange feeling - it was a summer of nostalgia and retrospection.

**MB:** How easy was it for you to write about yourself in the book?

**BS:** I now have total respect for anybody who writes without a guitar in their hands. I was used to doing interviews so I figured it would be easy. It wasn't. I wrote a whole bunch of stuff that I thought was great and then I went back and read it again. In the end I had Bob Santelli (the book's editor) give me a little guidance and I sat down, wrote about what was happening in my life at the time and what shifted my songwriting into a certain direction and kept it short, real short.

**MB:** Did you make a conscious decision to keep all those original song lyrics?

**BS:** Two things I've always held on to is my original guitar and my notebooks.

Everything else can go burn. These things I keep close. I don't have some of my very, very early ones, but I have almost everything since Darkness on the Edge of Town. It's strange. In the old days I'd write my verses and if I thought one of them was a stinker I'd be like, Throw it in the trash, don't let anyone see it. Now it's interesting how those songs ended up how they did and how they got here.

**MB:** There's an interesting note to Jon Landau (Springsteen's manager) circa Nebraska, where you mention that one new song, Born in the U.S.A, "might have potential"...

**BS:** I remember. At the time that version wasn't working out, but I figured that if I could connect a good song to this line "I was born in the U.S.A" I could be onto something (laughs). Sometimes you do know when something's going to happen - Dancing in the Dark I knew was a hit, the same with Hungry Heart. That stuff was pure pop, but you don't always know, sometimes you just have an inkling.

**MB:** How important is it for you to have hit singles?

**BS:** Lately I haven't seen myself as being in the hit singles business, but it's never primarily been what I do. I make albums. I get a kick out of having hit records, but I want to stick with my audience for a long time, I want to move with them and somehow that's always seemed more important than chasing hits.

When you settle into that way of working you become a horse in a horse race.

**MB:** Why did you slow down your work rate over the last 10 years?

**BS:** How made records have I made in '90s...(Pauses, mumbles) Tunnel...Human Touch...Lucky... Tom Joad. Y'know, before I used to be a five albums a decade man.

I guess I've been busy these last ten years putting my family together. I did make a whole album in the middle of the '90s that I chose not to put out. So that took up a year...

**MB:** Why didn't you release it?

**BS:** It was very internal, very relationship-based and after Tunnel of Love, Lucky Town and Human Touch, I didn't feel like another one. But as soon as I find another window - something like Tracks - I will put it out. I think it was a pretty good record.

**MB:** What's the best thing you've heard in the last 12 months?

**BS:** Beth Orton's Trailer Park is my favorite record of the past ten years (excitedly). She has a new album out? Great. I'll buy that. Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, they're good records too. I also listen to a lot of what they're now calling alternative country - Wilco, Whiskeytown, bands like that...

**MB:** Do you think some of those bands sound like you?

**BS:** It's just a country thing. I became a big fan of that music in my mid- twenties, when I was looking for a way to address more adult topics and that started to come across in my music. Like I'm on Fire - that was me trying to sound like Johnny Cash's Tennessee Three. It's country music and you're hearing that in me and in those bands.

**MB:** There's some great pictures of you and your cars in this book...

**BS:** There's so many pictures of me and my cars I've lost count (laughs). But I've never bought collector's items, they've always been what I call "drivers."

What am I running these days? A Ford Explorer for getting from A to B...a '48 Chevy truck, a '63 Impala - that's a Californian gangster car that Gary US Bonds gave me years ago. A Cadillac, of course. A Triumph motorcycle, an Indian...er (starts to sound embarrassed by number of cars owned) a, er, Harley Davidson...But like I said, they're all drivers.

**MB:** You came to London for the court case earlier this year (Springsteen sued UK label Masquerade for releasing "inferior" early-70s material). Do you come here often?

**BS:** To be honest, I'm not a big traveler. I do so much when I'm touring that I stay home when I'm not on the road. I was only there for a couple of days.

Where did I stay? (Pauses, then laughs) The hotel where Frank Sinatra used to stay...y'know, that's all they told me.

**MB:** Do you get hassled in the street much?

**BS:** Not too much. I'm lucky like that. I can go about my business. If I go check out a big show you'll hear "Brooce, Brooce" and people want autographs but most of the time it's OK.

**MB:** What motivates you now?

**BS:** The same things that did before. I'm still excited when I sit down with a guitar and I want to get a story across. It's as natural to me as the need to eat or the pursuit of love (laughs). I've got songs written now and I'm frustrated that I can't put them out tomorrow. The feeling doesn't go away.

**MB:** Did you ever think you'd spend your 50th birthday on the road with the E Street Band?

**BS:** Nope. It sounds good, though. I'm lucky in that I feel happy with my life and I've managed to sustain all the relationships that ever meant anything to me.

I still feel very young, except now I have what I didn't have twenty, maybe even fifteen, years ago, which is a bit of perspective. I'm looking forward to spending my birthday surrounded by the people with whom I've had my most adventures with. There isn't anybody else I'd rather be with.
