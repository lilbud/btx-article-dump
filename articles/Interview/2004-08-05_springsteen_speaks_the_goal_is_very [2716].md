A ROCK 'N' ROLL dream team including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam, R.E.M. and the Dave Matthews Band will launch its own political campaign over eight days in October. These artists will attempt to boost John Kerry's run for the presidency by raising money and rallying voters with 34 shows in nine swing states.

It's arguably the most ambitious attempt at political activism in rock history.

"Our main goal is to change the direction the government's been going in for the last four years, and to change administrations", said Springsteen in a phone interview with The Star-Ledger yesterday.

This is not a single tour, but six of them that will often come to different cities in the same state, on the same day. Springsteen and his E Street Band will headline an arena tour that also will feature R.E.M., John Fogerty and Bright Eyes. Other touring teams include the Dixie Chicks and James Taylor; and John Mellencamp and Babyface. Tickets for all shows will go on sale Aug. 21.

Here's what Springsteen had to say about the tour, and a few other subjects:

**Jay Lustig:** Were you involved in the initial talks to get this tour up and running, or did you sign on later?

**Bruce Springsteen:** It started, I think, in some discussions that (manager) Jon (Landau) and I had about wanting to do something this election season. I initially thought I was going to go out with my acoustic guitar, and play in some theaters in the battleground states. Just play my music and make some of my ideas known, and get the audience to think on it together, and try to mobilize the progressive voters. (Landau) had been speaking to some of the other managers of groups that were also interested in doing something, and I know he got together with Pearl Jam's manager, and R.E.M.'s manager, and the Dixie Chicks' manager, and slowly, this thing came into focus. They looked around for the organizations we wanted to work with and they put it together.

**JL:** So, to ask a basic question, what are you trying to accomplish with the tour?

**BS:** The goal is very clear. We want to change administrations in November.

Outside of that, we're looking to mobilize progressive voters. ACT (America Coming Together, an organization that will benefit from the tour) has got foot soldiers out there that are going to be going door to door and making sure people get to the polls. So it's a combination of voter mobilization and some education. It's going to be a lot of fun, and entertaining for people - and inspirational, hopefully. But our main goal is to change the direction the government's been going in for the last four years, and to change administrations.

**JL:** What would you say to, let's say, a conservative fan of yours, who might argue that musicians shouldn't be out there making political statements?

**BS:** This is one of my favorite questions ( laughs ). First of all, I can understand that there is an artist- audience bond, and part of the bond is, you look into the audience, and you see yourself, as I always do. And they look on-stage and they see themselves - hopefully, that's what we always hope for. Differences in opinions and beliefs, for some people, can sever some of those bonds. At the same time, the artist-audience relationship is more complicated than that. I always give the example of, I've gotten more inspiration and soul from, say, the movies of John Wayne, throughout my life .

. . I found them consistently inspirational. But I was never a fan of John Wayne's politics, you know?

Then the other answer, sort of, is, you have lobbyists in Washington, and they wheel and deal, and that's how they influence the government. "They're just businessmen. Why shouldn't they just shut up and do business, instead of getting involved in public policy?" ( laughs ). Big corporations influence the government in their fashion. You have labor unions who influence the government in their fashion. You have farmers, they influence the government in their fashion.

Well, artists write and sing and think. This is the way that we do it.

You can't tell anybody what to think. And I don't believe that people fundamentally even go to musicians for their political opinions. But I grew up in a generation where artists were always an alternate source of information.

And the means of communication are relatively locked down. On cable news, you pretty much have the same guys interviewing the same guys, who then turn around and interview those guys on their show (laughs) . We're another voice out there with a particular point of view, and hopefully it enriches my relationship with all my fans.

I always say, at our shows we've got Democrats, we've got Republicans, and people come and they take what they need from the music. But this was a particular election that I thought was probably the most critical election of my lifetime. I've been singing about the ideas of American identity and American ideals for 25 years. My point of view has been pretty clear. If you've been involved in my work, even a bit - unless you've done selective listening, which people do do with pop music ( laughs ) - it's not a secret where I've stood on most of the issues over the years. So, that's how it lays.

The artist-audience relationship is multifaceted and more complicated than "I've got to agree with everything they think", or "They have to agree with everything I think."

**JL:** So, obviously you're anti-Bush. Is it safe to assume you're pro-Kerry?

**BS:** Yes, I am.

**JL:** At Shea Stadium last October, you upped the political content of your show significantly, playing a tape of President Bush (talking about weapons of mass destruction) before "Souls of the Departed." Was there anything specific that prompted that?

**BS:** The issues of how we got into Iraq were quiet for a long time. I was sitting back watching that happen, and I had great reservations and fears about entering into that war ...I don't believe it was a Democratic or a Republican issue. I believe that any time we are going to risk the lives of our bravest young men and women, we honor those lives by doing it only under the most dire circumstances.

**JL:** On a lighter subject, any ideas what songs you're going to do on this tour?

**BS:** I don't know. The set will probably be shaped by the event. It is a rally.

But I think the show's going to be, hopefully, as it's always been, fun and inspirational, and joyous and serious. I'm not quite sure how it's going to shape itself. But we have an interesting bill, with R.E.M., and John Fogerty, who's going to sit in with the E Street Band. That's going to be a big thrill.

Bright Eyes - a great singer-songwriter (Conor Oberst). So I think it's going to be different and exciting, and a lot of fun for the folks to attend.

**JL:** When you say Fogerty will sit in, do you mean the band will back him in his set?

**BS:** We're gonna back John, yeah. John's coming, he doesn't have a band right now, so we're gonna do our best for him (laughs ).

**JL:** Will you be part of that, or will it just be the band?

**BS:** Are you kidding me? (laughs) I'm going to be playing those John Fogerty songs. You better believe it.

**JL:** Will there be some sort of grand finale or something?

**BS:** I don't know. The artists have just started to communicate a little bit. I hope we'll all get a chance to play a little bit on each other's music. That's part of the fun of the evening.

**JL:** I know Steven Van Zandt is very liberal, politically, but do the other members of the E Street Band share your convictions?

**BS:** Well, they're all coming ( laughs ). I didn't make anybody go. I know (drummer) Max (Weinberg) has done some work for John Kerry already. Steve has always been very politically involved. And the other fellows said they were coming along. And my wife (E Street vocalist-guitarist Patti Scialfa) is comin', too.

**JL:** Is it disappointing that there isn't more hip-hop, or Latin, or country music on this tour? That a broader range of music isn't represented?

**BS:** Yeah, that's always ...I know Jurassic 5 is coming, and some other folks. Given the time frame they had ...and I don't know how exactly all the acts were gotten together, but I guess they did the best they could.

**JL:** Is there any possibility that you could put out an album this year, or will that have to wait? Will this tour impact when you'll be able to put out another album?

**BS:** Not really. I don't have anything immediately in the works. I'm just doing some writing. Really, I took most of the year off. Patti was working, she got her record ("23rd Street Lullaby") going, so she needed some time to do her thing. She made a great record, and she's in the process of trying to get that out to people. I'm enjoying being home with the kids. If it wasn't for this, that's where I'd have been (in October).

In (the last) 25, 30 years, I haven't taken part in partisan politics. I've always believed it was best to keep an independent voice. But this was the rule-breaker. This is where I believe there are very basic questions of American identity and American values on the line, and it's stuff I've been singing about for 25 years, and so I've got to be there.

**JL:** Are the new songs you're writing politically oriented, and might you be doing them on the tour?

**BS:** I can't tell 'til I have one, you know. I have good ideas, but that happens all the time. I wish I was somebody who could work from the outside in, and pick a subject, and just go home and write a song about it. But that's generally not the way I've worked. I've got to sort it out from the inside out. I would love to have written a good song about this particular moment.

I'm sure there's a thousand songs there. If I can find the one I'm gonna sing, I'll sing it. But I never know until it's there.

**JL:** The last time you did something like this was the Amnesty International Tour, in 1988. Do you have good memories of that tour, and do you think it accomplished what you and the other musicians wanted it to accomplish?

**BS:** It was an incredible experience. I mean, I played in front of audiences we had never played to previously. India, Afric**BS:** And we were trying to raise the awareness of amnesty and human rights issues in the countries we visited. It was a pretty satisfying experience. I guess this is somewhat like a stateside version of it, in that we spent six weeks together, I think, the last time, and we did 16 shows.

This is a little bit different, though. I don't know of a situation where anything like this has quite happened before.

**JL:** Did you select R.E.M., Fogerty and Bright Eyes personally?

**BS:** Initially, when all the acts' managers started talking, we were just sorting out what we were going to do. I was originally going to play in theaters, and R.E.M. was going to play in some clubs, with Bright Eyes opening. So then we said, "Maybe I'll take the (E Street) band, and we'll play in some bigger halls." I had met R.E.M. on our past few tours, and was a big fan pretty much from the beginning. So I said, "Maybe they'll want to come out with us." So we asked and they said, "Yeah, that would be great", and they brought Bright Eyes along, who I was a big fan of, from the first record. And John (Fogerty) was interested in being involved. When I lived in California, we lived pretty close to one another for a while, so we knew each other pretty well.

**JL:** I just have one more question. Couldn't you persuade everyone to do at least one show in New Jersey?

**BS:** ( Laughs ) Well, hopefully New Jersey is pretty (solid) for Kerry. But we're going to be in Philly. There was a short period of time when all the acts were available, so we tried to go into the crucial places, where we might have the biggest effect.
