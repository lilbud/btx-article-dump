**What's the best concert you ever saw?**

Springsteen. I went to see him at the Ice Arena in Lewiston, Maine, in 1977\.

He played for about four hours. It was fantastic. There's so much energy, so much generosity in the show, and so much real life in the music. He was totally athletic, and he'd jump into the crowd, lay on his back and spin around. He was a great showman.

**Do you respect him as a storyteller?**

I respect him as a songwriter and the insight in his songs. My favorite album of his is Nebraska. I knew from the beginning of "Atlantic City" that it was amazing. He had really grown as a songwriter. He's done stuff in music that nobody else has done. That line in "The River", "Now I just act like I don't remember, and Mary acts like she don't care." Let's put it this way, it's a long way from "Palisades Park" by Freddy Cannon.

**I feel like you and Bruce would both be doing what you're doing, even if you weren't paid for it.**

Yeah, I think it's fair. And it'd be fair to say that we were both self-taught with a lot of ambition, a lot of drive to succeed, because I have that in me too. I have this one thing that I can do, and that's something Bruce expresses in a lot of his music.
