WEEKEND MUSIC BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: STORYTELLERS ON: VH1 PREMIERING TOMORROW AT 10 P.M.

If you caught Bruce Springsteen's Somerville Theatre shows two years ago, then you'll be right at home with tomorrow's episode of "Storytellers", in which he plays songs on acoustic guitar and piano, and talks about them in detail, offering insights as though this were a college seminar.

Springsteen recently taped the VH1 special in a small theater in Red Bank, N.J. He sings two new songs ("Devils & Dust" and "Jesus Was an Only Son"), but most of it is an illuminating trip through his archives. He starts with "Blinded by the Light", which he wrote at age 23 while living above an abandoned beauty parlor in Asbury Park. "I wanted to get blinded by the light and do things that I hadn't done before", he says.

In sometimes rambling but never uninteresting fashion, he imparts rapid-fire thoughts and sweeps through "Brilliant Disguise", joined by his wife, Patti Scialfa (the only time she appears). He follows with his 9/11 anthem, "The Rising", stopping on almost every line to describe how a dying man will miss the "physicality" of his life, then explaining how the song changes to gospel music. And in "Devils & Dust", prompted by the confusion of the Iraq war, he cites the "untenable choices" of an American soldier and "the price that inflicts in blood and in spirit." He further adds his concern for the "erosion of civil liberties" in the United States.

Springsteen talks about divinity in "Jesus Was an Only Son" (before joking, "end of sermon"), then lightens up with the set- closing "Thunder Road", during which he shares his youthful belief that rock 'n' roll would lead to "a sense of a larger life and hopefully more and better sex." From the sacred to the profane, it's Bruce at the core
