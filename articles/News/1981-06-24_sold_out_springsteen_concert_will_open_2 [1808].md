EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., June 23--- Although the lockers and dressing rooms will not be finished, the building's sound system will not be functional and painters and technicians will still have hundreds of jobs left, the 20,000-seat Brendan Byrne Arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex will be packed with rock-music fans in less than two weeks.

On July 2, the concrete-and-steel arena four miles west of the Lincoln Tunnel will be opened with the first of six Bruce Springsteen concerts that were sold out 36 hours after they were announced.

"The response was tremendous", said Loris F. Smith, general manager of Giants Stadium and the new arena, which dominate the 730-acre Sports Complex site. "We got 50,000 pieces of mail the day after the radio spots were played. The next day we had to turn back another 50,000 pieces of mail at the Post Office."

Work Behind the Scenes

The arena - 110 feet high, 408 feet wide and 475 feet long - will also be used for sporting events and exhibitions and as a convention center. The use of 428-foot steel roof trusses provides audiences with an unobstructed view

"The public will not be aware that there is still work going on", Mr. Smith said, noting that the unfinished work would be in behindthe-scenes areas such as exhibition areas and locker rooms.

Construction began in December 1979 and is still going on despite a $2.5 million payment to Terminal Construction Corporation, the contractors, for overtime work aimed at meeting a December 1980 deadline. Design modifications and other factors have raised the cost from an estimated $55.1 million in 1979, when the first bonds were sold, to almost $85 million, with some elements, such as an electronic scoreboard and a 250-seat restaurant, still to be added.

The new arena here is expected to have some initial impact on Madison Square Garden, but officials of the New York City arena anticipate no long-term competitive effects. Michael Burke, the Garden's president, said many events would be booked into both facilities. 'The Garden Is the Gareen"

"I don't see attendance dropping off at the Garden", he said. "This is a huge area and we have an enormous public on which to draw. The arena may have an initial competitive advantage because it is brand-new and because of its pricing policy.

"They will rent the arena to people for less than what our rate card is, but the Garden is the Garden is the Garden. No amount of bricks and mortar can replace the intangible magic that comes from the name."

Mr. Burke said that while the Garden had lost a track meet to the new arena because there was a conflict in scheduling dates. "Disney's World on Ice", for example, will open at the Byrne Arena and then go to the Garden, he said.

Officials said that the decision to name the arena after Governor Byrne was introduced in an executive session of the sports authority last fall and approved by unanimous vote at a public session in November. The Governor, they added, had nothing to do with the decision.

"The Governor had no say about it", said a spokesman for Mr. Byrne, who is in the Soviet Union on a trade mission with officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "He can't name the arena and he can't unname it - it was solely a function of the sports authority."

The Springsteen concerts will take place before the arena's official dedication at noon July 14, a few hours before "Disney's World on Ice" moves in for a two-week, 25-performance stand. The ice show will be followed by Hambletonian Week early in August, with the Meadowlands Grand Prix horse competitions and a three-day sale of standardbred yearlings.

"We feel that week will tie the three facilities together and really tell the story of what this complex is all about", said Robert E. Mulcahy 3d, chairman of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which oversees the operations of the stadium, the race track and the arena. Soccer, Sulkies and Singing

The Cosmos of the North American Soccer League will play Jacksonville, Fla., at Giants Stadium on Aug. 2, he said, and later that evening, the $1.7 million Woodrow Wilson Pace for 2-year-old pacers - the "richest race in the world"

- will be staged at the Meadowlands track. Later in the week, the $800,000 Hambletonian, one of harness racing's most famous events, will held at the track and a concert by John Denver will be presented in the arena.

The New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association, who will test the floorboards in their new home in October, had been scheduled to play some games in the arena last season, but construction delays forced them to use the Rutgers gymnasium in Piscataway. The authority was required by its contract to lend the team's owners, Meadowlands Basketball Associates, $2.05 million - $50,000 for each of last season's 41 home games that could not be played at the arena - at 12 percent, with only interest payments due in the first year.

Officials estimate that 225 dates will be booked during the arena's first year of operation. But although the arena can serve as the home rink for a major- league hockey franchise, no team will be using it as a home arena for the coming season. Last Friday, arena officials announced that the Major Indoor Soccer League had signed a five-year lease for a team yet to be named, and today the Cosmos announced the signing of a 10-year lease on the arena for the team's indoor schedule.

When work on the arena is finished in a few months, Mr. Mulcahy said, the Sports and Exposition Authority will study the operation of the three main centers before going ahead with any further major construction.

"We want to make sure that we can move the people into the site and within the site before we look at anything else", he said. "Once we know everything is functioning as it should, we will sit down and take a look at where we are going from here."
