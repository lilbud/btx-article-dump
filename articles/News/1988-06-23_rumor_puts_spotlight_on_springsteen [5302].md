NEW YORK --- Patti Scialfa, now reportedly dating the boss in Bruce Springsteen`s E Street Band, is a longtime Jersey Shore backup singer who readily admits her big break came four years ago when Bruce put her in his band.

She`s having her big media break now, however. With Springsteen officially separated from his wife of three years, Julianne Phillips, Scialfa and Bruce have reportedly become an item.

As recently as last month`s Madison Square Garden concerts, however, the pleasant and modest Scialfa was just another band member, often wandering into the backstage "hospitality suite" (tables of popcorn and other carnival food) to chat amiably with friends and strangers.

It was June 25, 1984, when Springsteen invited her to join the band, on the eve of its staggeringly successful "Born in the U.S.A." tour. She had four days to learn the marathon show, but then, she didn't have a big featured part. Her only brief solo came on "Cover Me", though she shared Springsteen's microphone on a couple of songs.

Still, it was a dream come true. She had auditioned for one of Springsteen's bands in the late '60s, when she was in high school, only to be turned down because she was too young. So she completed school and took "the usual" jobs at the shore while she worked toward a singing career.

She went on the road with Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes for a while, as well as Jukes offshoot band La Bamba and the Hubcaps (who are playing with Springsteen on the current tour). When Springsteen rediscovered her, she was 32 and singing with Cats on a Smooth Surface, the regular Sunday night band at Asbury Park's Stone Pony.

"See", she told an interviewer in 1984, "you can meet a nice guy in a bar."

Actually, a story that circulated in mid-1984 had Springsteen discovering her as a waitress and impulsively asking her to join the band. It`s not exactly true, but it was far too charming for anyone to deny. Or even discourage.

Springsteen said during the "Born in the U.S.A." tour that adding Scialfa to the band, despite her minor musical role, represented a major change in the band`s chemistry. With a woman on the stage and on the road, the whole "male bonding" process of the band changed.

Springsteen had used women on stage before. Francine Daniels and Delores Holmes sang in his early bands, and violinist Suki Lahav played in the E Street Band during the mid-`70s.

But Scialfa was something different. With her red hair and striking figure, she, like sax player Clarence Clemons, was almost more important as a physical presence. Thus it was considered a major change for this year's "Tunnel of Love" tour when Scialfa started the show in Clemons' traditional position on Springsteen's right.

She was also playing guitar, an enterprise she modestly said she was learning as fast as she could.

When the band comes back from Europe in late July, however, presumably the first questions she hears will not be about her progress with the six-string.
