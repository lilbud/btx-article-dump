It came as a shock when Bruce Springsteen, during a concert radio broadcast from Stockholm on July 3, declared his involvement with the Amnesty International tour. His short speech, followed by a moving version of Bob Dylan's "Chimes of Freedom", are the focal point of a four-song live set released yesterday.

Entitled "Chimes of Freedom" (Columbia Records) and released in multi-formats of vinyl, tape and CD, the Springsteen package is an eloquent scene-setter for the Amnesty tour. It's a practical scene-setter as well, for some of the proceeds will benefit Amnesty, which has booked Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman and Youssou N'dour into six continents in the next six weeks.

The Springsteen speech pays tribute to the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, which is sanctioned by the United Nations. His point is hammered home in "Chimes of Freedom", a song as relevant today as when Dylan wrote it in 1964. The song stems from a dreamlike thunder-and-lightning storm in which Dylan imagines bells tolling "for the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse/ An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe." Springsteen does it justice with a worldly wise treatment that rises in passion as it sweeps through its seven-minutes-plus length.

The other three tracks are from his recent "Tunnel of Love" tour. They're like a condensed, miniversion of the tour, covering the new, country-style song "Tougher Than the Rest" (the tour was filled with new material); a rollicking B-side "Be True" (the tour was filled with surprise B-sides); and a stately acoustic version of "Born to Run", in keeping with the tour's theme of how much Springsteen has changed from his mid-'70s party day
