"New Delhi can dance!" complimented Bruce Springsteen. And how! At the Human Rights concert, he had Delhiites swinging with his E Street Band. But for a full five minutes it was Shefalika Mishra who stole the show. The 18-year-old, pretty Maurya trainee was the lucky one to boogie with the Boss. And the 60,000-strong crowd roared its approval.
