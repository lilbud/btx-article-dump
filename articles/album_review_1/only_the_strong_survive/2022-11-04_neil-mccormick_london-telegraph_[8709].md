For his 21st album, one of the greatest rockers of all time takes on vintage R'n'B. What's not to love?

Bruce Springsteen's new album Only the Strong Survive will be released on November 11

Bruce Springsteen is one of the greatest rock stars of all time, a passionate and profound singer-songwriter on a mission to make music that matters and songs that serve the people. His 21st album, however, lets him do something else: just sing his heart out for his pleasure and ours.

Only The Strong Survive is the second Springsteen album comprising entirely of cover versions, the other being We Shall Overcome in 2006, a rambunctious exploration of folk and gospel as an exercise in communal singalong. If that was all about the power of shared voices, this is about Springsteen's individual voice. He has set himself the task of scaling what many might consider the summit of pop singing by tackling 15 vintage soul and R'n'B songs, including such exalted classics as I Wish It Would Rain by The Temptations and Jimmy Ruffin's What Becomes of the Brokenhearted.

It is clear from the opening snare crack of the Jerry Butler title track that Springsteen is enjoying himself, launching into some feisty back and forth with a lush squadron of backing singers. The key, tempo and time-switching arrangement are identical to the 1969 original, but what is immediately noticeable is how beefed up the sound is, how the drums punch, strings float, guitars tickle and bass buoys the whole bottom end. A big ensemble of session musicians (not his usual E Street Band, though their ripe horn section plays a vital role) effectively recreate classic arrangements for modern ears. To use one of those automotive analogies Springsteen is so fond of, it's like a vintage racing car has been stripped down and reassembled with 21st century turbo charged power. In the driving seat, Springsteen handles this old beast like he was born to it.

Has Springsteen ever been considered purely as a singer? He has a gruff, rough, manly voice with a lot of lung power and a slow modulation. He doesn't really have the inherent ache and delicate flexibility of the soul singers he most admires and has to locate different flavours of hurt masculinity in covers of William Bell's I Forgot to Be Your Lover and Tyrone Davis's Turn Back the Hands of Time. But Springsteen has charisma and conviction to match anyone who has ever picked up a microphone, allied to a dynamic grasp of exactly when to ramp up and when to hold back, and he delivers these songs like they mean the world to him. In other words, he's got soul.

Only the Strong Survive reflects Springsteen's pre-fame days as leader of a covers band on the New Jersey shore, reminding us how much R'n'B filtered into the epic rock sound he ultimately developed. Frankly, he's always going to come out second best to a singer of the cosmic class of Scott Walker on The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore, yet with its melodramatic grandeur it could fit easily into his own back catalogue.

Springsteen tackles Ben E. King's 1962 single Don't Play That Song! fully aware there is no possibility of going head-to-head with the 1970 version by Aretha Franklin. Where she scales melismatic heights, Springsteen roars of his wounded love like he's trying to get a crowd to back him up in a squabble.

It's not exactly darkness on the edge of town because he's having way too much fun, but it's pretty irresistible all the same, like stumbling into the world's greatest bar band playing the world's greatest setlist at the wildest shindig ever thrown. At 73, Springsteen sounds like he's having the time of his life. Boss soul - what's not to love?
