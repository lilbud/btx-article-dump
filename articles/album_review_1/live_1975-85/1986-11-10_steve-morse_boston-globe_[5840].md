The First Church of Bruce convenes today at area record stores. Diehards have finally gotten their wish -- the release of an authorized, five-record concert package, "Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: Live 1975-85."

Random comments from church members over the weekend, as they awaited their vinyl equivalent to the Holy Grail:

- A sportwriter: "This is going to do it. I've got a 20-year-old stereo, and this will finally be the incentive to go out and buy a new one."

- A local entrepreneur: "They say this will be the Christmas album of the year, but just watch: Everyone will already own one by then. This is going to outsell Pet Rocks."

- An advertising executive: "Five records of Bruce in concert? I think I'm going to have to take a vacation soon, so I can listen to it all."

The hysteria has been carefully orchestrated. Springsteen's label, Columbia Records, has dropped hints for weeks about which songs will be included. And they issued a special eight-song build- up tape to radio stations on Friday.

"It's probably going to arrive by armored car", WBCN disc jockey Ken Shelton joked on the air that morning.

Columbia also has cited preorders of 1.5 million copies -- including cassettes and compact discs. That's less than the 1.9 million for the Jacksons"

"Victory" album three years ago, but still the largest dollar- volume preorder in history, since each package contains five units. Andbecause the album and cassette versions will retail for an average of $25, and the CDs for $39, you're talking a $50-million gross right out of the gate. That, too, is unprecedented.

So much for the marketing details. What about the music?

Despite the juggernaut of hype, it's everything it's cracked up to be.

It's drawn from every phase of Springsteen's Horatio Alger career, for at least two songs are taken from each of his seven albums. A loosely based chronology, it traces the cocky bravado of his New Jersey youth as a busdriver's son; on through a mythic rise which now finds him embraced as an American rocker without peer and as a thinking man's patriot who speaks eloquently for Vietnam veterans, the unemployed, the hungry and the disenfranchised.

While the choice of songs will be endlessly debated, there is no doubt that Springsteen, who spent the last year preparing these tapes, has given us his personal legacy. These are the songs he wants remembered 20 years from now.

While the album is crammed with crowd-pleasing rock (and will be a party album "from now until forever", as a friend joked over the weekend), he also includes his finest songwriter ballads.

In this regard are three straight tracks from 1982's daring acoustic album, "Nebraska." These follow an oddly slowed-down but poignant cover of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land", which, Springsteen says during an introductory rap, was Guthrie's "angry answer" to Irving Berlin's "God Bless America." Then follows Springsteen's own anger in "Nebraska" (about an average citizen pushed to the breaking point by the "meanness in this world"); "Johnny 99" (about an unemployed auto worker who shoots a night clerk and gets 99 years in jail); and "Reason to Believe", where amid a mournful harmonica he rasps about a woman whose lover "up and left her", and of a man whose fiancee ditched him at the altar "and he's wonderin' where can his baby be." As Springsteen marvels in the last verse: "still at the end of every day, people find some reason to believe."

This ability to touch the downtrodden, and even psychotic, side of life, then to release it through backbeat-blazing rock 'n' roll, is the key to Springsteen in concert. And it's here by the spadeful. The five records roll continuously from despairing empathy to communal joy. The songs, complete with audience screams, singalongs and cries of B-r-u-c-e!, B-r-u-c-e!, flow together as if this were one long concert, though recording was mainly done at the Roxy in Los Angeles in 1978, the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1984 and the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1985. And the sound quality? It's magnificent.
