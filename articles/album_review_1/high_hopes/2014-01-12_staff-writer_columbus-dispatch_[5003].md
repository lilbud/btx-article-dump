Bruce Springsteen's new album, High Hopes, would seem to have hodgepodge written all over it.

None of the songs is brand new. Eight are originals that didn't make the cut onto studio albums. Some are longtime staples of Springsteen's live performances and three are covers, including the title track.

High Hopes couldn't possibly cohere as a unified artistic statement, or count as a significant addition to the prodigious Springsteen songbook, could it?

Well, no and yes. It is true that his 18th studio album, which will officially be released on Tuesday, doesn't stick to a single stylistic or thematic tone.

And it makes use of an array of implements in the New Jersey rocker's musical toolbox.

But that isn't such a bad thing. Since reuniting in 1999 with the E Street Band, Springsteen has been in his most prolific recording period.

Which isn't to say that High Hopes is teeming with lost masterpieces. It is uneven in spots and suffers at times from an overload of Tom Morello, the Rage Against the Machine guitarist who filled in for Steven Van Zandt on an Australian tour last year.

Morello in many ways is to be credited with the album's existence: He suggested that the rousing, brassy High Hopes, which serves up musical uplift while looking grim reality in the eye, be added to the set list.

The new friend of the Boss plays on 10 tracks, and sings a duet on a thunderous remake of The Ghost of Tom Joad, the folkie title track to Springsteen's 1995 solo album. Including an extended guitar freakout, it runs seven-plus minutes.

Faring better as a sweeping epic is American Skin (41 Shots). It was originally written in response to the 1999 death of African immigrant Amadou Diallo.

Throughout High Hopes, Springsteen moves from full-throated rockers to whispery folk. In the latter category, the keeper is Hunter of Invisible Game, one of three songs that will be featured on tonight's episode of the CBS drama The Good Wife.
