Call it patronage, insider politics, Wall Street privilege.

It has given rise worldwide to the Occupy movement --- a yearlong citizens' protest against the entitled that, until now, didn't have a soundtrack.

Bruce Springsteen tries earnestly to provide one on his 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, out today.

The chorus of the opening song should ring true to anyone who expected fairness from a civic or business leader and wound up with something less. We Take Care of Our Own is one of Springsteen's most pointed political statements, outlining a vision of what he thinks America should be and how it has fallen short.

The album is primarily the work of Springsteen and producer Ron Aniello, with dozens of guests --- including since-deceased E Street Band saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who is heard on two tracks. The sound is less E Street Band rock than a mix of traditional music (folk-based country, blues, gospel) and electronic filigree (samples of vintage recordings and rhythm loops). It's also swamped in harmony vocals, with no less than 12 backup singers, as well as a choir.

As is the case with a number of recent Springsteen albums, the production seems forced. The songs are about the death of something --- not only jobs but belief and spirit --- and the fight to restore them. Yet that desperation rarely comes across in the music.

Death to My Hometown rages about a community toppled without a shot being fired by "the robber barons." But it sounds almost cheery, with penny whistle and accordion leading a jaunty march down Main Street and Springsteen even adopting an Irish accent.

Shackled and Drawn conjures up a prison work song. Yet the arrangement employs a cast of thousands in a rousing chorus, as if to undercut the dire reality of the lyrics.

The album could have been the sequel to Nebraska, Springsteen's 1982 album about ordinary people struggling to retain their jobs, their dignity, their moral compass. But, with a stadium tour looming with the E Street Band, Springsteen opted for Born in the U.S.A.-style fist-pumpers.

The album is bookended by its best songs, We Take Care of Our Own and the twangy We Are Alive, which echoes Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.

Springsteen's heart is in the right place. But he went for stadium bombast instead of the grit that such stories of hard times demand.
