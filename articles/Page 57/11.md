A flood of newspaper stories has described the "new" Bruce Springsteen as a stable family man and mature rock hero who has grown up after a lifetime on thunder road. By his own account, he's also been eager to shelve performance stereotypes. Before launching his first tour in four years, he discussed tightening his famed marathon shows, dropping old songs and focusing on new tracks from his two recent, rite-of-passage albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town." But guess what?

He's confounded expectations again.

Despite talking about being "Bruced out" on his old, bop-till-you-drop concert days, he's again setting Olympian standards for endurance (playing up to 3 1/2 hours per show), while adding and subtracting new and old songs with a spontaneity that he hasn't shown in a decade.

Springsteen, who plays the sold-out Worcester Centrum tonight and tomorrow in the second stop on his American tour, just finished 10 eyebrow-raising nights at the Meadowlands in New Jersey. While a number of observers, including this one, felt his new backup group lacked the presence of his longtime E Street Band, there was no denying Springsteen's commitment to shake up these Jersey shows and jar his sedate new image.

"In interviews, he's talked about no longer needing the 'drug of performing'but he's now acting in direct contrast to that", says Charlie Cross, editor of "Backstreets", the Seattle-based, nationally-respected Springsteen fanzine.

"Where he implied that he's gotten over long concerts, he's back doing them.

Maybe he needs the stage more than he was aware."

Indeed, when Springsteen played Europe last month, he started in Stockholm with a two and one-half hour show -- a full hour less than the final show at the Meadowlands last week. That gig also featured a whopping 31 songs and put the crowning touch on a Jersey homecoming (Springsteen hails from Freehold, N.J.) that saw him mix in 15 additional songs from the ones he performed during his warmup month in Europe.

"Springsteen has now done 58 songs total for this tour", says Cross. "That compares to the previous 'Tunnel of Love' tour, where he did 55 different songs. And it took him almost a year to build up to that number. Also, during that 'Tunnel of Love' tour, he did 10 shows in a row with the exact same set.

That gets frustrating for old-time fans. But there haven't been those same frustrations on this tour. He's really been into it. I think his core fans are more important than ever to him -- and he knows that changing songs will please them. He hasn't changed a concert tour this much since 1978, during his 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' tour."

As Springsteen recently told London's Q magazine: "I don't think people go to concerts for a fundamentally intellectual experience. It's more like, Hey, how does it feel?" And it's apparently feeling looser and looser, judging from his willingness to depart from his earlier aim of stressing post-"Born in the U.S.A." material this time out.

The "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town" albums are still, of course, getting a strong airing. There's an average of five "Human Touch" songs per night (though the hit title track is played less and less) and six or seven per night from "Lucky Town", says Cross, who keeps meticulous computer printouts of every Springsteen show and has released a compilation book, "Backstreets Springsteen", that is must reading for diehards.

But Springsteen has started to loosen up, partly because some fans have insisted on it. He played Milan, Italy, last month and finally gave in to shouts for his signature 1976 tune, "Born to Run." (He had played the song acoustically during his "Tunnel of Love" tour in 1988, but he's now playing a band version.) And he then shortly added "Thunder Road", an oldie that he didn't do at all on his last tour.

And here are the other songs he's added on various nights since his tour began, most of them oldies: "Sandy", "Atlantic City", "Spirit in the Night""Open All Night", "Jersey Girl", "Trapped" (by Jimmy Cliff), "Darlington County", "All the Way Home", "99 and 1/2 Won't Do" (a Wilson Pickett tune), "Pony Boy", "Cross My Heart", "I'm on Fire", "Book of Dreams", "Red-Headed Woman" (an unrecorded song about his wife and former backup singer, Patti Scialfa), "Because the Night", "Growing Up", "Racing in the Streets" and "For You", which is from his very first record, "Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J."back in 1973.

Apart from this unexpected cross-section, another surprise is that Springsteen has mainly dropped the cover songs that used to spice his encores. For instance, he used to do a "Devil with a Blue Dress" medley of Mitch Ryder songs; "Not Fade Away" by Buddy Holly; and "Travelin' Band" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. But as he told Q magazine: "I've got my own oldies now."

Another reason for skipping such oldies may be that his new band of mostly young players (Shayne Fontayne, guitar; Danny Simms, bass; Zachary Alford, drums, and sole E Street holdover Roy Bittan, keyboards) did not grow up with '60s and '70s music in the same way the E Street Band did. "The E Street Band could be a human jukebox. They could kick out nearly any Otis Redding or Buddy Holly song on the spur of the moment", says Cross.

Yet while there may be stylistic limitations with the new band, Springsteen is not letting it stop the reinvention of his own material. Concludes Cross: "He's been unpredictable. His own songs keep changing from night to night. And that's made for better shows as the tour has gone along."

VITAL STATS

SHOWS: Tonight and tomorrow at Worcester Centrum. BAND: Roy Bittan, keyboards; Shayne Fontayne, guitar; Danny Simms, bass; Zachary Alford, drums, and six backup singers including Crystal Taliefero (formerly with Bob Seger and Billy Joel) and R&B legend Bobby King. TOUR'S OPENING AND CLOSING SONGS: During his recent 10-night stand at the Meadowlands, Springsteen opened shows with three different songs: 'Better Days', 'Red Headed Woman' and 'Local Hero.' He also ended with three different songs: 'Jersey Girl', 'My Beautiful Reward' and 'Bobby Jean.' CONTROVERSIAL NEW BIOGRAPHY: Former Springsteen manager Mike Appel just released 'Down Thunder Road', a smarmy, tell-all look at the rift between Appel and Springsteen in 1976 after "Born to Run" was released.

Springsteen sued Appel, declaring Appel 'cheated' him and was guilty of breach of contract, then Appel countersued. The suit was settled out of court in 11 months, though the scars clearly remain. The book is loaded with minor inaccuracies and psycho-babble. But it's intriguing in discussion of the tug of war between Appel and future Springsteen manager Jon Landau and in Springsteen's depositions, complete with four-letter words.
