"Ladies and gentlemen", announces a raspy-voiced Bruce Springsteen from the stage of the Capitol Theater in Passaic, N.J. It's the 75th performance of the 1978 tour and all the members of Springsteen's E Street Band have been introduced - save one. The Boss pauses while drummer Max Weinberg keeps the beat pumping and the momentum building.

"King of the World", begins Springsteen, with all the melodrama he can muster.

"Master of the Universe, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall refineries in a single bound. It's a bird! It's a plane! It's the Big Man - on saxophone!"

King of the World? Master of the Universe?" the Big Man is asked.

"It's a hard job", deadpans Clarence Clemons, during a telephone interview from Big Man's West, a music club he owns in Red Bank, N.J. "I have to work overtime."

Clemons laughs. "When Bruce first did it, I was so embarrassed. I'm a shy guy, you know. I don't blow my own horn - well, I do blow my own horn but it's on stage. But when I'm talking to people it's just, whatever. No way am I a star.

I work hard. I get paid. It's a job that I love. I don't put myself above nobody or nothing."

On stage, however, perspectives change. When the hulking Clemons, Springsteen's white-suited main man, grips his sax, and chases Springsteen across the stage, he does seem to be of appropriately mammoth proportions.

"That's the way I feel when I'm playing", Clemons admits. "Like I am King of the World."

Last summer Springsteen and the E Street Band concluded an 11- month international tour. Springsteen is America's biggest rock star and, as such, he plays large arenas. Clemons enjoyed it, but says, "I just didn't get off like I wanted to. It's a lot different when you play for 20,000 people. The guy in the last row could be playing checkers or something. It's that close intimate thing that I miss when we play the big places."

And so nearly three months ago, Clemons formed Clarence Clemons and the Red Bank Rockers, named after the site of his 600-seat club. The Red Bank Rockers, a 10-piece band that includes E Street organist Danny Federici, ex- Southside Johnny guitarist Billy Ryan, Warren Zevon guitarist David Landau and a four- piece horn section, is on an East Coast, weekend-only club tour which stops in Boston for a gig Saturday night at the Channel.

They're touring by bus. "Like the old days", says Clemons who is temporarily stepping out from The Boss' shadow. "We'll all pile in there and have fun.

It's different when you travel by plane. You don't have to carry your own sax.

All you gotta do is show up and play and it becomes something else. This is the raw beginnings."

Clemons sings ("Hey look I never did it before in a solo vein, but I'm loving it"), plays sax, and leads his band through a set that will have a familiar sound to it. The repertoire consists mostly of early '60s rock 'n' roll, rhythm and blues and soul classics - the inspiration behind Springsteen's music - plus "a tribute to the greatest saxophone player who ever lived, King Curtis, and some stuff you never heard of."

The Red Bank Rockers will be touring at least through mid- February and playing every Sunday night at Big Man's West. As of last Friday, they'd played three gigs and Clemons was raving about the symbiosis. Playing clubs, Clemons says, "rekindles your kinship to rock 'n' roll, to the public. When you got a small club you're touching everybody and everybody's touching you."

The goals, Clemons implies, are simple. "We're just having fun and turning a lot of people on to some good music. I'm playing every song that I ever wanted to play and doing a few originals here and there. We're not looking for a record deal or nothing."

Clemons talks about the music he's playing two ways. The more direct description: "It's like going to a Bruce and the E Street Band encore."

Springsteen's shows take the listener on a complex artistic journey that ranges from exultation ("Two Hearts", "Prove It All Night") to defeat ("Point Blank", "The River").

Springsteen's encores, however, showcase his roots. They're gutsy, consistently uplifting songs done by the likes of Sam Cooke, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Gary US Bonds, Elvis Presley, Sam and Dave and the Animals.

Basically, the rock 'n' roll has rhythm and blues overtones and drives straight and hard.

Clemons' other way of talking about the music is with a philosophic passion that approaches religious fervor. "One thing that kind of got me into this"he says, "was that I was in this club one night and I heard Try a Little Tenderness' (Otis Redding's soul classic) done disco. And I wanted to cry. I said, No, no, no, there'll be kids growing up thinking that's the way it's supposed to be done.' "

The glossy, high-tech disco boom of the mid-'70s dismayed Clemons. "What was it? Where's the reality? I got the beat, but where is the reality, the feeling from the soul? That was missing - like a shell it was empty.

"Rock 'n' roll took a big step backwards. We have to go back and become crusaders for rock 'n' roll again by going back and bringing it back like it came around the first time. We're just bringing it back to reality."

Clemons is likely the most noted and influential saxophonist working in rock 'n' roll. More and more bands are using sax players and Clemons says, "I feel like I played a strong part in bringing the saxophone back to its rightful place in music. The saxophone is a rock 'n' roll instrument."

He's not a closet jazz cat: "I'm not into free form. I need a pedestrian beat.

I was born and raised on rock 'n' roll."

Clemons, also part of the Asbury Park scene that spawned Springsteen, linked up with Springsteen and the E Streeters 10 years ago and the story of his joining the group has taken on mythic proportions. Springsteen, a master of tall tales, doesn't exactly discourage this.

In his Springsteen biography, "Born to Run", Dave Marsh recounts a typical rap Springsteen delivered in concert. Springsteen and guitarist Miami Steve Van Zandt were walking down an Asbury Park boardwalk at 4 a.m. when they encountered this big man in a white suit carrying a saxophone. The man was coming at them and they were scared. When he got close they threw down all their money, hoping to appease him, but the big man just put out his hand.

They touched, sparks ignited ...and, bang, the band kicks into "The E Street Shuffle", a song, says Marsh, of "unity and passion."

And then there's the rap about Clemons descending to earth in a space ship . .

"I'll tell you the whole thing", says Clemons, enjoying the recounting of the legends. "I was playing with this band called Norman Selvin and the Joyful Noise, an oldies group. There was this girl in the band, Karen Cassidy, and her roommate was going out with Bruce. Karen said there's this guy you've gotta meet - when you guys meet it's gonna be fantastic. So one day she introduced me to the guy at the Student Prince, the place he was playing in Asbury Park. I said Hey can I sit in?' He heard from Karen that I was around and I was playing so he said sure. And it was like magic. It was like I'd been playing with him forever.

"It was like I walked in from outer space or something. In his artistic mind, theatrically, that's poetic justice."

Springsteen will not be joining Clemons on any of the gigs. "I'm his biggest fan and he's my biggest fan", says Clemons, "but I don't want him to show up.

It would be bad for both of us - this is totally separate from him."

Clemons' parting advice: "Bring your seatbelts."
