Rock star Bruce Springsteen, watching Ringo Starr and his band perform in Holmdel, N.J., gave the audience a treat Friday by jumping on stage and playing alongside the former Beatles drummer. Springsteen, who made his name playing small venues on the Jersey shore, joined Starr at the Garden State Arts Center for the concert's final four songs, beginning with the Beatles classic "Get Back." Starr is on a 30-city US tour, which began in Dallas on July 23 and closes in Los Angeles on Sept. 4. Among his accompanying musicians are two members of Springsteen's E Street Band, saxophonist Clarence Clemons and guitarist Nils Lofgren. Springsteen joined the band in "Have Some Fun Tonight", Starr's early solo hit "Photograph" and the finale, the Beatles' "With A Little Help From My Friends." Also joining the band for the finale was comedian John Candy, who clowned and played the tambourine.
