Bruce Springsteen doesn't let you sit down for long. For a ballad or two, fine. But when he's ready to set sail, you'd better be ready to be up there with him. He deleriously challenges your endurance like no other rock artist today.

A typical challenge came last night after he'd played an hour and a half and was about to declare an intermission. Most rock acts would have called it a night right there, but Springsteen calmly said he'd be back, adding with a clenched fist, "So you'd better be able to rock all night long."

And after a half-hour break, that's just what he did, scaling another four- hour evening as though it were a cruise to the local drugstore. Is this man ticking like the rest of us, or what?

The Grateful Dead are famed for playing as long as four hours, but let's not forget that half the time they're either tuning up their instruments or wandering off on laid-back solos. Springsteen, on the other hand, goes from song to song as though he were working out on a punching bag. There's little letup, and if you should lag behind, he'll do what he did last night during "Promised Land" - jump to the front of the stage, shake his hands in the air and scream, "What are you waiting for?"

And up you'll go, locked in the grip of a man who gives you everything you could ask for in a concert.

Springsteen just plain outdid himself last night. I had seen his Providence show on Thursday, and the song selection was similar but he was far less energetic. Last night, he moved much more (even dancing with a woman from the audience on "Sherry Darling"); did more of his patented raps (a beauty before "Independence Day", when he described his narrow-minded father as "afraid to dream, afraid to think that things could ever get better"); and engaged in more theatrics with saxophonist Clarence Clemons (during "Fire", he squared off with Clarence in a would-be street fight, threatening to crumple Clarence's cowboy hat and finally deferring ...of course ...to Clemons' man-mountain size.)

What made the show so spectacular was not only the liberating length, but the sweep of material Springsteen offered. He's been pigeonholed as an R&B artist, but never did that label seem so confining. Springsteen touched on almost every kind of American music, from roadhouse dance tunes ("Cadillac Walk"); street anthems ("Born to Run", which he opened with); acid rock (uncorking his own nerve-fiber guitar solo during "Because the Night", reminding you of just what an outstanding guitarist he is as well); country music (the aching melancholy of "Wreck on the Highway", the title of which he took from Roy Acuff); and even parlor music, which he delved into on a smartly resurrected "4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)", complete with Danny Federici's elegant accordion twists.

There were so many highlights that I'm frankly left gasping here at the typewriter. He did "I Came for You" for the first time in years. He did a perfectly timed segue between "Two Hearts" (where he talks of finding his "special one") and "Prove It All Night" (where he and his special one do just that). And he snuck in "I Wanna Marry You", a ballad he introduced by saying movingly, "Your dreams remain dreams until you take a chance with people."

It was all a wonderful way to turn the corner from John Lennon's death. It made you realize just how much we need this thing they call rock, especially now
