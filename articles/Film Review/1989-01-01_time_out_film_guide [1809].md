No Nukes (1980) Director: Julian Schlossberg, Danny Goldberg, Anthony Potenza

First the good news: 20 minutes of Springsteen. The bad news is a further 80 minutes of concert and behind-the-scenes footage which, unless you're a fan of the soft rock icons of the late '60s, looks like a catalogue of aged hippies reliving their former glory. Filmed during five concerts performed for free and organised by Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE), it's a pity that the movie builds so obviously towards Springsteen's appearance, defusing the very real political message of the MUSE team (Nuclear Energy is BAD for you) and turning Springsteen into nothing more than a crowd-puller. His performance is astonishing , joyous and revelatory. (Haskell Wexler directed the documentary footage, and Barbara Kopple the Madison Square Garden sequence and Battery Park Rally.)
