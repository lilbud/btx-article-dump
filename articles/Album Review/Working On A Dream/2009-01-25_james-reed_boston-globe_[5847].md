Bruce Springsteen has always had a tendency to follow up a blockbuster with a curveball. If he's been consistent in anything, it's his predilection for surprise.

Just look at his catalog. After "The River" exalted him to arena-ready rock god in 1980, he released "Nebraska", an unvarnished acoustic gem that ruminated on the country's dismal state of affairs. The bombast of 1992's "Lucky Town" dovetailed into the quiet grace of "The Ghost of Tom Joad" three years later.

And no one was expecting 2006's "We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions", a rollicking, good-time folk album that preceded the full-throttle rock of last year's "Magic", which reunited Springsteen with the E Street Band.

Just 16 months later comes another surprising detour. "Working on a Dream"out Tuesday but already streaming in its entirety at [www.npr.com](http://www.npr.com/), is a Springsteen album that doesn't sound like it has Bruce Springsteen at its core. That's an odd sensation considering that when you hear Springsteen's music you're always keenly aware of his persona - his history, his politics, that voice.

By turns jangly folk-rock and bright '60s-inspired pop, "Working on a Dream" presents Springsteen in a more personal state of mind. After the rallying spirit of "We Shall Overcome" and the seething anger of "Magic", it's glaring how apolitical the new album is. This is not Springsteen's soundtrack to the Obama administration.

It is, however, a sonically adventurous album, with the E Street Band again accompanying him. But the songwriting far too often feels like an afterthought, canned and jarringly shallow. We learn Springsteen is in love with the "Queen of the Market": "I take my place in the checkout line/ For one moment her eyes meet mine." I'm hesitant to repeat the rest of the lyric, but here goes: "And I'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted away."

Produced by Brendan O'Brien, who also worked on "The Rising", "Devils & Dust"and "Magic", the album opens with "Outlaw Pete", a driving, eight-minute epic flush with strings and a cliched cowboy storyline. The surprise in question on "Surprise, Surprise" is this clunker: "C'mon open your eyes and/ Let your love shine down."

Springsteen fares better when he explores the possibilities of a broad musical palette. He's nearly unrecognizable on "This Life", a sublime slice of power pop that would have suited Roy Orbison, with the Beach Boys on gilded harmonies. On "Good Eye", Springsteen takes a stab at cosmic blues with a cacophony of distorted sounds. But then the momentum is upended by "Kingdom of Days", which drivels out of the speakers with the kind of pat chorus you'd think Springsteen would be incapable of writing.

Curiously, "Working on a Dream" comes with a DVD on the making of the album, but it's safe to say this isn't a classic that warrants it. You'll just have to wait for the next curveball.
