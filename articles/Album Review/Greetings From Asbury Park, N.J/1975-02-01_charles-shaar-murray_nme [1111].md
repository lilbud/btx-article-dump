BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN IS an excellent rhythm guitarist, which just about compensates for the fact that he grows a terrible beard.

He also has a knack of making otherwise respectable people say things like "I listen to Bruce Springsteen for dear life, the way I used to listen to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Chuck Berry", or even "I have seen the future of rock and roll, and it is called Bruce Springsteen."

This last eulogy emanated from no less a personage than Jon Landau, the man who produced Back In The USA.

Springsteen was, purely on the strength of Asbury Park, probably the most spectacular of the recent crop of New Dylans.

He qualified because he was (a) Jewish, (b) the owner of the aforementioned terrible beard, an outbreak of bumfluff which instantly flashed connoisseurs back to the growth sported by Zimmenheimer at the Isle Of Wight, (c) he writes lines like "madmen drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat" and so on ad infinitum into the sunset.

Pretty good, huh?

Plus he sings like Van Morrison and has a back-up band who, on the basis of the photo on the back of The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle are absolutely the meanest-looking gang of switch-blade jugglers since the original line-up of the Butterfield Blues Band. These guys just reek of the street; real punks, not a gang of over-dressed poseurs with season tickets to Max's.

Finally, the whole schmear was imported from New Jersey, which, as everybody knows, is real effnic like, and full of that real nitty-gritty street consciousness which is where it's all really at.

So you got a smart-ass Jewish punk writing neo-Dylan lyrics complete with enough densely-packed internal rhymes to choke Sir John Betjeman, backed up by a serviceable R&B oriented band who include among their numbers not one but two spades, plus a wop and a Chicano, all of whom wear army-surplus clothes which pay lip-service neither to glitter-trash to SuperSly pimp-cool.

Credibility incarnate.

Still, it's more than a year since that new-Dylan nonsense went down, and since CBS have just shovelled both albums out again to get them re-reviewed and spark off some hoopla for Brucie's tour, it seems like a reasonable time to get down and do some of that there re-evaluatin'. So have at thee, Springbum.

As a lyricist, Our Brucie is very similar to that breed of guitarists prevalent some years ago who couldn't bear to play at anything less than top speed, and attempted to jam every lick they knew into every single solo.

On Asbury Park, he crams ten minutes worth of lyrics into three minutes worth of song, machine-gunning words until they collide with each other in mid-air, the bad lines smothering the good like weeds choking out the roses in a flower-bed where the gardener is asleep at the switch.

'Growin' Up' is a good case in point; the tune's a lot like 'My Back Pages', and most of the lyrics are pure cosmic punk garf, but just when you think that you've been totally suckered into wasting your time, Springsteen hits you with a gorgeous line like "I pushed B-52 and bombed 'em with the blues" and you realise that anybody who could come out with a line like that has to be worth listening to even if he's totally incapable of acting as his own editor and thereby forces the listener to do it for him.

Then it's almost another full verse of drivel and moonshine I before he comes back with "and I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car" and that image is almost as exhilarating as its predecessors have been irritating and Springsteen's twisted your synapses again by being brilliant and awful in adjacent lines.

Which is infuriating, really, because it leaves you with the nagging feeling that anybody who scatter-guns so many lines is bound to win the stuffed panda at least once in any given song, and maybe he ain't as good as he seems after all.

If it's still necessary to defuse the "New Dylan" hoax, then a swift listen to 'Mary Queen Of Arkansas' should be equal to the task.

Here Springbok hauls out his acoustic guitar and mouth-harp and tries for an action replay of 'To Ramona', fumbling the ball so embarassingly that it's almost a relief to get back to his basic R&B musical stance on 'Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?' even though this time he's going on about "wizard imps and sweat sock pimps, interstellar mongrel nymphs" ad infinitum.

Still, at the end of the first side Springsteen saves his ass in fine style with 'Lost In The Flood'.

Using the flood as a handy metaphor for imminent-doom'n-destruction-and-even- for-(gulp)-life-itself certainly isn't unique (see Dylan, B.), but here Springsteen really makes it count, anchoring himself down with almost pedantically "street" imagery over a steady rolling backup and building up to singularly powerful climaxes at the end of each verse.

So maybe he's not a bozo after all, huh?

Watch him try not to klutz out on the second side.

Well, 'Angel"s more or less a dead loss, and that leads us onto 'For You', which contains more lyrical dandruff but which fair skips along like a young lamb doing the limbo on a GEC hotplate, with distinct signs of life from the drummer. However, from here on in things start getting really good.

Exhibit A is a cunning little ditty entitled 'Spirits In The Night', which musically recalls the title track from Van the M's Moondance and lyrically carries some of the ambience of 'And It Stoned Me' from the same album.

Springsteen discards his tongue-twisting IBM approach in favour of a rather charming relative simplicity to tell a story of a gang of street types driving off into the hinterlands to get stoned and enjoy a midnight swim, and while it's far less ambitious than most of the rest of the stuff on the album, it's easily the most satisfactory, with a gorgeously loose-limbed R&B swing and a beautiful chorus.

Finally, 'It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City', which coalesces the verbal- diahorrea approach and the street-punk imagery better than any of the other attempts included here. It's one of the tracks that Bowie was raving about a couple of years ago when he ran down a frenziedly drunken number about Springsteen over supper in Paris.

Greetings From Asbury Park N.J. sounds like the product of an extremely talented young guy frantically trying to be impressive and attempting to do half a dozen things at once and succeeding only in nearly capsizing himself in the process.

On the other hand, his second album The Wild The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle showed him as having gotten far more used to his backup musicians (most of whom had played on the first album).

Instead of being singer-songwriter-plus-band, it was band-featuring-singer- songwriter, and while the material wasn't as startling, the music was better.

It gets off to a blinding start with 'The E Street Shuffle', which'd be a natural for the J. Geils Band if they weren't so hung up on recording their own lame material these days.

The intro, with Springsteen playing some flashing Telecaster rhythm under a stuttering piano loop from the miraculously-named David L. Sancious comes as near to getting me off the floor and strutting around the living-room as anything else I've heard recently, and it's got a great line about "if the kids ain't dancing they're hung up in a scuffle/snakeskin suits backed with Dee-troit muscle/doin' the E Street shuffle".

I hate to say it, but damifitain't better funk than most of those spade sharpies are laying down these days.

The vibometer sinks about eight points with '4th Of July Asbury Park (Sandy)" which is dreary as hell, and all that really needs to be said about it is that the Hollies have covered it on their new elpee, and if you think that I can't wait to hear it, then you're absolutely right.

The rest of the album is okay, but unspectacular; I've listened to side two three times and I can't remember anything about it, whereas all of the first album and side one of E Street had made a definite impression after on play.

Bruce Springsteen has very little taste and no small endowment of pretentiousness, but when he pulls it off he comes on like a man who knows what he's doing at least part of the time.

If he can develop a little more control without dissipating his energy in the process, he may even end up being as good as his more vocal supporters claim he is.

The only thing that really worries me is that the critics who go into convulsions over Springsteen are the same ones who raved over Elliott Murphy.
