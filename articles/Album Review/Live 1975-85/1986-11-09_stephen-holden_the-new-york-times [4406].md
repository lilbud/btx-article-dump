'Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band Live/1975-85" (Columbia 40559; LP, cassette, compact disk), a massive five-record retrospective album that arrives in stores tomorrow, represents an unprecedented event in popular recording. A three-and-a-half-hour, 40-song career summary, recorded over a 10-year period in clubs, concert halls and stadiums across the United States, it is the sort of anthology one expects to be released late in a performer's career, or posthumously.

Instead, this monumental album, which comes with a 31-page booklet of lyrics and photographs, arrives just when the 37-year-old singer and composer is at the peak of his popularity and creative powers. Mr. Springsteen's last album, "Born in the U.S.A.", has sold more than 11 million copies in this country.

And "Live/1975-85", which costs about $25 ($39 for the set of three compact disks), with the price differing from store to store, has received advance orders of more than 1.5 million copies. No other record album has done such a large dollar volume of business before its release.

It has long been said of Mr. Springsteen that he must be seen in concert for his music to be fully appreciated. And while "Live/1975-85" doesn't let us literally "see" Mr. Springsteen perform, it offers by far the broadest perspective yet of an artist whose music connects many of the major strands of American rock tradition, most notably Chuck Berry's twangy country-blues, Bob Dylan's oracular folk-rock poetry, Otis Redding's southern soul and the producer Phil Spector's surging teen anthems.

"Live/1975-85" is loaded with history. At the very least, it is a record of how one singer and his band have helped to sustain and put their personal stamp on a rock tradition that electronic keyboard technology has steadily eroded over the last decade. More important, the album is the pop-record equivalent of an epic American novel, its story told in the ungrammatical, rough-hewn vocabulary of rock.

Because Mr. Springsteen is so popular he is almost worshipped by some, and because his songs are profoundly concerned with American ideals of community - family, hometown, and nation - the album has a historical resonance that goes beyond pop culture. The driving spirit behind most rock-and-roll has traditionally involved fantasies of personal transcendence and escape from everyday responsibilities. Mr. Springsteen, like no other rock and roller before him, has given this romantic vision a tragic dimension by putting it in a starkly realistic context. Mr. Springsteen's mature songs are set against a bleak backdrop of dingy factories, shabby wood frame houses and deserted railroad tracks.

Instead of being presented chronologically, the songs are arranged in thematic sequences structured to draw conclusions about the past and speculate about the future. As an autobiographical portrait of Mr. Springsteen, "Live/1975-85" overflows with antic humor, romantic drama and, above all, restless, peripatetic, motor-driven action. The vivid small-town settings of his early songs are framed against a mysterious, inviting American landscape that the singer, borrowing from Chuck Berry, names "the promised land."

"Live/1975-85" describes Mr. Springsteen's search for salvation as he grows up and away from suburban small-town life and sets out to explore that territory. But instead of leading to a blissfully happy ending, his odyssey takes him to hell and back. Although he achieves a kind of redemption, it is a bitter knowledge of life's essential unfairness, leavened with compassion and a determined self-reliance. The core of the album is an extraordinary sequence of songs in which Mr. Springsteen confronts the irrational social and economic forces that shape - and sometimes violently destroy - American life. Although barely mentioned, the cataclysm at the center of the album is the Vietnam War, an event that in Mr. Springsteen's view casts an ominous shadow into the future.

For the first two records, "Live/ 1975-85" offers a colorful rock-and-roll phantasmagoria of youthful passion in songs that are alternately thrillingly energetic, poignant and funny. "Ohoh come take my hand/ We're riding out tonight to case the promised land", Mr. Springsteen pleads to a sweetheart in the opening cut, a beautiful acoustic version of "Thunder Road", recorded 11 years ago at the Roxy in Los Angeles. The songs go on to describe the rambunctious, wildly romantic teen-age life that is ultimately left behind.

Father-son strife ("Adam Raised a Cain"), adolescent hanging out ("Spirit in the Night"), the tawdry glamour of the Jersey shore ("4th of July, Asbury Park"), Romeo and Juliet love games ("Fire", "Rosalita"), Marlon Brando stud-rebel fantasies ("Growin' Up" and "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City"), and acute small-town claustrophobia ("Backstreets") are remembered in the vivid, gawky rock-and-roll street poetry of Mr. Springsteen's early and mid-70's voice, and in music by the E Street Band that suggests a restless tear around the American highway.

The swinging, loose-jointed bar-band rock of the band - its centerpiece the majestically gregarious honk of the saxophonist Clarence Clemons - musically epitomizes the joyous, freewheeling sense of camaraderie that runs to the heart much of Mr. Springsteen's music. "Hungry Heart" (an arena audience singalong), "Two Hearts", a roaringly exuberant "Cadillac Ranch" and a playfully sexy "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)" show off Mr.

Springsteen and the band at their most raucously playful.

But beginning with "Independence Day", a brooding song about a young man leaving home, the mood of the album begins to shift. With just a slight alteration in tone, Mr. Springsteen's charging anthems can turn desperate. And "Badlands" reeks with cold sweat as it contemplates a deep animal fear not often admitted to in mainstream rock songs. This fear, which Mr. Springsteen perceives as an ominous, growing undercurrent of American working-class life, haunts much of the rest of the album. The other side of the coin is a fierce, nagging desire: "Poor man wanna be rich/ Rich man wanna be king/ And a king ain't satisfied/ Til he rules everything."

In an urbanized upwardly mobile society, Mr. Springsteen asks, is it possible for ordinary working people to build and sustain a stable, responsible sense of community? For the next one and a half records, the songs address the economic plight of America's working class with increasing despair and rage.

"Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Racing In the Street" look sorrowfully at the energy and dreams squandered on small-town drag racing Later, Mr.

Springsteen introduces a slow, measured rendition of Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land" with a monologue about how the song was written as an angry response to Irving Berlin's "God Bless America."

It is followed by three songs from "Nebraska", the 1982 acoustic album of cowboy-folk songs in which Mr. Springsteen began writing first-person monologues in the voices of characters totally outside himself. Sung in a sullen twang, this trilogy about senseless murder, injustice and betrayals so harsh they render life meaningless casts an even deeper chill. It hurts to hear Mr. Springsteen mumble in a tone of ornery deadpan despair: "Struck me kinda funny, seem kinda funny sir to me/ At the end of every hard earned day/ people find some reason to believe."

Mr. Springsteen makes the "Nebraska" songs pay dividends by placing them in the album just before the concert version of "Born in the U.S.A." Simply because its title is so catchy, some have mistaken the song for an aggressively jingoistic anthem. In fact, the song is an unemployed Vietnam veteran's scream of anguish when he finds himself unwanted and uncared for in the homeland he defended.

In the next number, "Seeds", America all but disappears into a black hole.

This previously unrecorded song, the relentless cry of an out-of-work, homeless oil worker in Houston, weaves together images of blind industrial power and brutal social indifference with visions of suicide and social disintegration. "You ain't gonna find nothin' down here friend/ Except the seeds blowin' up the highway in the south wind", the narrator warns, howling a tune that is essentially one repeated note stretched along an unresolved blues chord.

The album turns poignantly reflective for a moment with a spoken monologue in which Mr. Springsteen recalls battling with his father in the late 60's. The tale, which has the understatement of a Raymond Carver story, segues into "The River", the bleak folk ballad about a shotgun marriage and prematurely withered lives set in an ugly industrial town. Then, in another spoken monologue, Mr. Springsteen remembers watching the Vietnam War on television and tells his audience: "If you're in your teens in 1985, blind faith in your leaders or in anything will get you killed." The singer and band immediately launch into a jackhammer-charged rendition of Barrett Strong and Norman Whitfield's 1970 anti-war chant, "War."

With their relentless power-drilling rhythms and steely chainsaw textures, "Born in the U.S.A.", "Seeds", "War", and two other songs, "Darlington County" and "Working on the Highway", all compare hard labor with warmaking. Without actually preaching, Mr. Springsteen repeatedly makes the point that the same will and energy that drives productive physical labor can just as easily power destructive violence. All it takes for one to be perverted into the other is an absence of meaningful work.

After contemplating the void so intently, "Live/1975-85" gradually lifts its gaze upward in a final sequence of songs that tentatively affirm love and community. The optimistic spirit of these songs comes more from the solidity of the music and from Mr. Springsteen's rugged singing than from what the songs actually say. The love demanded in "Cover Me" is more protective than romantic, as the narrator pleads, "The whole world out there/ Just trying to score/ I've seen enough/ I don't want any more." "Bobby Jean", "No Surrender, and "My Hometown" all say goodbye to youth and to a vanishing small-town way of life.

Musically, the high point of the album is a roaring, three-dimensionally rich concert version of Mr. Springteen's most famous mid-70's anthem, "Born to Run", that builds to such an exalted peak the music seems to take off into the air. But even here, the most memorable lines offer a painful observation on the futility of fuel-injected dreams: "The highway's jammed with broken heroes/ On a last chance power drive/ Everybody's out on the run tonight/ But there's no place left to hide."

"Live/1975-85" brings to a magnificent synthesis just about all the impulses that have fuelled rock music since it surfaced in the mid-50's as a mass cultural movement. You can get get caught up in the visceral charge of its engines, sing along with its chunky tunes and dream its romantic dreams and still feel the cold wind of the history blowing through its pages.
