The tale of Bruce Springsteen's 'lost album' The Promise is full of heartache and legal drama. There is lovely pop here, but it's not the pop of its time

"Remember", says Bruce Springsteen to a bandmate, "there's always room to throw out." The black-and-white footage shows an astonishingly beautiful young Springsteen in the studio. He is slowly driving his fellow musicians crazy with his capacity to write new songs, record them and then toss them away. The album to be born in June 1978 is Darkness on the Edge of Town, and its gestation appears to be a process of elimination as much as of creation.

Even when it comes to the songs he plans to keep, Springsteen --- whose three previous albums had swelled with lyrical and musical excess --- is intent on stripping them down. "Roy, you playin' any fills?" he asks his piano player Roy Bittan. "If so, they're out." The tone is mock-Bossy, with a hint of mincing, but he's clearly serious.

These moments appear in Thom Zimny's recent documentary, The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, which --- along with other home-movie clips and live footage --- fills no fewer than three DVDs in an extraordinary (and pricy) new box set with an annoyingly similar name.

For many fans, this set evokes a lyric from Darkness: "...if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice". The album holds a special place in our hearts; without the hype of Born to Run, the mega-popularity of Born in the USA or the scattergun eclecticism of The River, Darkness is the pure stuff, unadulterated Springsteen at his creative peak. In my own New Jersey adolescence, it was the first record, by anyone, that I fully inhabited, and I've heard of a fair few Irish adolescences in which it played a similar role.

As Springsteen describes it in the recent interview that anchors Zimny's film, Darkness was a "tone poem" of "power, directness and austerity". The documentary relates Springsteen's obsessive pursuit of a relentless drum sound. "Stick!" he would scream, annoyed at hearing the drumstick rather than the primal crack-boom of Max Weinberg's drums. Many songs on the album are so austere that the "melody" consists of little more than whatever note Garry Tallent's bass intones whenever the bass drum sounds.

With all that stripping clean and throwing away, what was left out? And why was Springsteen only just getting into the studio nearly two years after being the magazine-cover face of record-industry hype with the release of Born to Run in 1975? The answers to these questions go to the heart, not only of this autumn's "new" release, but also of the special place Springsteen holds in the history of the business --- as opposed to the art --- of rock'n'roll.

For most of the gap between Born to Run and Darkness, Springsteen was hamstrung by a lawsuit with his former manager that kept him out of the studio. Although it was settled quicker than, say, Muhammad Ali's ban from boxing eight years earlier, it has taken on some of the same weight for fans.

We revel in his defiance of "the Man" --- but we still wonder what might have been, if he hadn't been kept out of the ring in his late-twenties prime.

The Promise, tantalisingly, purports to give an answer, in the form of a double CD of 21 songs --- Springsteen's "lost album", the one he says "could have/should have been released" in those gap years. (Just to cement the confusion, this album is also called The Promise, with a different ­mouthful of a ­subtitle.)

Springsteen is hardly the only big old star to root through the archives or rejects for Christmas stocking-fillers. Yet he and his PR machine are uniquely playing "back to the future", magically trying to recreate the "missing"

Springsteen album. The vaults were full of unfinished works, so on this album about half the songs are substantially revised, with vocals, instruments and even lyrics that weren't there at the time. In the liner notes, he writes absurdly: "I did what I would've done to them at the time and no more." Not even "what I think I would've done". No, the 61-year-old Bruce knows the 27-year-old Bruce so well he can reproduce exactly what his younger self "would've done".

Tampering aside, the claim that is this is the "lost album" is demolished when we recall a handful of the best outtakes from this period appeared in 1998 on the four-CD album Tracks and are not repeated here.

Nonetheless, the two discs of The Promise comprise a good old/new Springsteen album. From the opening piano and ­harmonica of Racing in the Street (78) --- like the version on Darkness itself but in a less monotonic voice and fatalistic key --- to the moving lament of the title track, it often seems a more deliberate successor, or response, to Born to Run than ­Darkness itself does.

Most of its songs are far more conventional but, like Darkness, it is shot through with anxiety --- mostly romantic yet often material. These are the songs of a man who was worried about money. These days, Bruce isn't so worried. The box set contains a DVD of the E Street Band in 2009 playing the Darkness songs. On the title track, Springsteen changes a lyric, "I lost my money and I lost my wife", to "I lost my faith and I lost my wife".

During 1976-8 he had every reason to worry: his former manager Mike Appel had failed to pass on a half-million-dollar cheque from the record company, and legal battle was joined. In the documentary, the 21st-century Springsteen insists "It wasn't" --- the word barely gets to an unconvincing final "t", even by the low standards of New Jersey diction --- "a lawsuit about money. It was a lawsuit about control." Yet, five minutes later, he's acknowledging how precarious his position was by the time the suit was resolved: "If I'd a had that one success [Born to Run] I'd a went back [sic] to Asbury Park millions of dollars in debt rather than the other way around." The unusually fractured syntax from the carefully spoken Springsteen may indicate how painful the thought remains.

The two "new" CDs of The Promise, along with Darkness, seem to contain more references to money, price, cost and status than anything in the pop-music canon outside Marvin Gaye's What's Going On. And that's not the only link to soul music. On The Promise, there are several direct lines to Otis Redding and Motown. Ain't Good Enough for You is stuck catchily in my head like Martha Reeves or the Supremes.

Guitarist Steve Van Zandt suggests Springsteen could have been known as one of the great pop songwriters if he hadn't kept throwing out catchy songs. The Promise seems to have been produced with that thesis in mind but assess it sceptically. There is lovely pop here, but it's not the pop of its time. A few tracks sound like they could have charted in the mid 1960s --- but not the late 1970s.

In fact, while Springsteen was paring Darkness to a tone poem, he was letting "pop" songs out to other performers. Several went to Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, his Jersey-shore pals, a group it would be only slightly cruel to describe as a truly great Sam Cooke tribute band. Even with songs such as Springsteen's Talk to Me --- itself one of the highlights of The Promise, with the singer crying repeatedly to his lost love "I got a full week's pay!" over a Stax-like horn section --- they made little impact on the charts.

The two 1970s hits that feature in ­Springsteen's own versions on The Promise don't support Van Zandt's thesis, either. Patti Smith reached the top 20 with Springsteen's Because the Night after he couldn't finish it, but that was scarcely pop. The Pointer Sisters' version of Fire got to No 2; but the siblings were something of a novelty act, with clothes and harmonies drawn from mid century. They suited the song perfectly yet scarcely provide evidence of Springsteen's contemporary pop sensibility --- not that it matters to the catholic and often nostalgic tastes of 2010 when we can enjoy such work guiltlessly.

We remember 1977-8 for disco, punk and the death of Elvis Presley. Of these, only Elvis figures prominently on The Promise, both as a source of inspiration and with a mention in a lyric. Punk is more relevant to the humourless austerity and explosive power of Darkness than to anything on the "missing" album.

So, we've got an unproven thesis about Bruce the lost pop genius; a rather questionable archive exercise; and a good-but-not-great Springsteen album that melds a part (mainly the black part) of his 1970s sensibility with the pop nostalgia that dominated his 2009 Working on a Dream. His current single, Save My Love, is a mostly new, lightweight concoction that would have fit on that album.

It's the video for that single that reminds fans why we care. Shots, old and new, of Bruce and his band mix with images of his fans and even of some of the bootleg LPs that helped us fill those 1970s gaps. In this era of industry paranoia about piracy, the video reminds us how the pirates of yore gave us Springsteen's music when the industry couldn't oblige. Bruce gets it.

On the song The Promise, recorded in 1977 --- the nearest thing to a track "about" his lawsuit --- Springsteen manages to configure what he had lost and what he feared losing as a sort of heroic sacrifice he had always intended to make: "we were gonna take it all and throw it all away". Well, he didn't. We didn't. And (to hell with sacrifice!) 33 years later we're glad he and his work --- the great, the good, the indifferent --- were carried back to us from the edge of the business's abyss.
