Boxed sets flood the market every fall, with new ones coming out seemingly every week. But none tells more about the inner workings of an artist than "Bruce Springsteen: Tracks", already being called the Holy Grail of boxed sets. It's easy to see why, because it boasts a staggering 56 previously unreleased songs that track Springsteen from a cocky Bob Dylan acolyte to a mature, self-realized artist with an acute ear for promises broken and fulfilled.

What's apparent is that Springsteen left more good songs off his studio albums than most composers write in their entire recording careers. No wonder he's agonized so much over his albums. He's had to make hard choices in deleting some absolute gems, which are finally collected in this project. Sure, there are some songs that should have been left in the vaults -- but most will be an ear-opening experience for anyone with the faintest love of the prolific poet- rocker from the New Jersey shore.

The box, released today with a suggested price of $69.98, charts Springsteen's vast improvement as a singer and composer. The third and fourth CDs (containing music from his "Born in the U.S.A." period up to today) especially show a remarkable consistency. The first two CDs are spotty, featuring a lot of bar-band filler that simply points the compass to where he was going. The last two more than make up for any lost time.

Springsteen has been accused of not rocking enough in the '90s, of being too reflective, but that image is smashed by such previously unreleased '90s tunes as "Leaving Train" (which sounds like Steppenwolf meets Pearl Jam) and the blazing "Seven Angels", with slashing electric guitar courtesy of Springsteen himself.

The reflective side is covered as well, on '90s standouts such as "Lover Man" (about a romantic reconciliation told through a woman's eyes), "Loose Change" (about the aftermath of a one-night stand with a woman in a "friendly bar"), and the poignant "Brothers Under a Bridge", about a group of scarred Vietnam veterans who live as exiles in the California mountains.

This last song was a feature of Springsteen's "Tom Joad" tour of two years ago. It shows how Springsteen has tinkered with and updated his own work through his 25-year career. There's another previously unreleased song with the tellingly similar title of "Brothers Under the Bridges", from 1983. It also centers on a group of castoffs drinking beer and wine under bridges -- but the Vietnam angle, and the deeper focus, were added later.

Time and again, this box shows Springsteen borrowing from himself to craft something better later on. An early tune, "Seaside Bar Song" from 1971, has the line "The highway is alive tonight", which later turned up on the epic "Born to Run." The early piano ballad "Iceman" has a verse that later was folded into "Badlands": "I wanna go out tonight / I wanna find out what I got."

Springsteen has been finding that out ever since his solo audition for Columbia's legendary talent spotter, John Hammond, in 1971. That audition was taped and appears here for the first time. A nervous but not-to-be-denied Springsteen barrels through his colorful story songs "Mary Queen of Scots" ("I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade"), "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" (where he manages to rhyme, however awkwardly, the words cobra, Casanova, and supernova), and the fast-paced "Growin' Up", with the marauding line "The flag of piracy flew from my mast." It was youthful, brash, at times brilliant, and enough to get him signed.

This first CD in the box, though, has a high cringe factor as well.

Springsteen's folk-rock bravado, and his rock-and-classic-R&B elements, are in place, but his voice warbles on a number of tracks and there are some embarrassing lines like the unctuous "Ooh, ooh, ooh, I want to rendezvous!" and "You got to tell the girl you need her -- you got to give her a great big kiss!" Still, the innocence is endearing.

The second CD is much better. It consists of the unreleased album Springsteen made around the time of "The River", in 1980. His songcraft is deepening, as in the bittersweet "A Good Man Is Hard to Find", about a forlorn Pittsburgh woman; and "Stolen Car", about a dreamer whose love is squashed, whereupon he takes to -- where else? -- the highway. It's the pop-music equivalent of John Updike's "Rabbit, Run."

Then comes some priceless material left off the 12 million-selling "Born in the U.S.A." album (1984). There's an acoustic title song that is a long way from the anthemic version finally released. And there are hard-rocking, treasure-trove songs showcasing the E Street Band, such as "Johnny Bye-Bye" (about Elvis Presley being found "slumped up against the drain with a whole lot of trouble running through his veins"), "Cynthia" (a flat-out song of female admiration), "Frankie" (about spending a night at the drive-in with his lover), and "TV Movie", in which he laughs about someone wanting "to make a TV movie out of me" (it has a cynicism about the media that would show up later on "57 Channels").

Springsteen's ability to limn small-town dreams is vividly portrayed in 1983's "Car Wash", about about a woman who works at one and dreams of a million- dollar recording contract. And his own dreams are nurtured in 1987's "The Wish", a deeply personal song about Springsteen's mother buying him his first guitar ("a Japanese guitar") as a Christmas present.

Springsteen's E Street Band has been a memory for a decade now (though there's talk of a reunion tour next summer), but what most surprises on the boxed set is the quality of Springsteen's nearly one-man-band, previously unissued studio songs in the '90s. He adds E Street synth-keyboardist Roy Bittan and late drummer Jeff Porcaro to some tracks, but he's solo on others, such as the brilliant "Going Cali", about a man who heads to the West Coast only to meet a woman in a California desert bar and have a son with her. It's typical of how much Springsteen respects the ever-changing, ever-unpredictable side of human nature. It remains an essential cornerstone of his art, as this must-have boxed set affirms.
