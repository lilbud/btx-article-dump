A SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE sketch of a few seasons back poked fun at Roy Orbison by reducing him to a caricature: motionless stance and ever-present shades. With this overdue collection --- given added weight by being a double album --- Bruce Springsteen has proven himself to be equally typecast. Unable or unwilling to cast off the cliches of his past records, The River's attempt to Make a Statement is buried in an avalanche of repetition and evident lack of inspiration.

Like a painter with a monochromatic palette, Springsteen is limited to working with his too-familiar "street" character. As a result, his undynamic new tracks lack both the urgency and clarity of past successes. Instead of impact or emotional urgency, Springsteen substitutes a ridiculous "party atmosphere."

The River adds up to a water-treading exercise that neither upholds his standards of excellence nor explores any new avenues.

Springsteen deservedly commands a lot of respect; despite all the drumbeating done on his behalf, nothing he's ever said or written would suggest he believes any of the messiah hype. His ethics, overall accessibility and commitment to maintain self-imposed standard are both rare and commendable.

Now, if only the results were more interesting. Throughout his recording career, he's repeatedly done things that repel my sense of rock aesthetics and reduce his music to laughable bombast.

Springsteen has two major stumbling blocks: stunningly bad vocals and perenially flawed lyrics. His wounded buffalo noises should be reserved for football grandstands. He also repeats lines mercilessly and meanders into a high register that is not his domain; the sound of his voice cracking and straining destroys any mood he might have built up (e.g., 'Drive All Night': on side four). Lyrically, Springsteen is capable of powerful tableaus and stories, but he insists on tossing in his crutchwords --- "night", "street", "darkness", "drive" --- as if he were totally unable to imagine the sunlit world not moving along a thoroughfare. That sort of monomania might be okay for an entire album, but not a career.

The River paints a bleak picture of the American dream gone sour: kids forced into marriage and adulthood; people disgusted with their lives and jobs; lovers and families who know they're doomed to grow apart. Everything is wrapped in automotive settings and metaphors that are tenuous at best. All Springsteen's songs are about those same dismal lives in one way or another, just as the highway metaphor runs through his work. Almost all The River's themes, in fact, could have been consolidated into one song.

With a few exceptions, the album's music offers little excitement and less novelty, relying on fairly routine Springsteen moves. The songs can be classified as lightweight, uptempo party tunes with familiar phrases and Jukes-like joviality; slow, somber work-outs that sound (at worst) like Jackson Browne; and medium-tempo numbers in the vein of 'Tenth Avenue Freezeout' which work about half the time. Numbers that seem likely to survive include 'Two Hearts', 'Independence Day', 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)', 'Cadillac Ranch', 'Fade Away' and 'I'm a Rocker'. The remainder adds up to precious little, and all of side four is simply awful.

The ultimate failure of The River lies with its language. When he started out Springsteen' songs were embarrassing fairy tales populated with foolishly named characters and crammed full of juvenile cleverness. By the time of Born to Run he had developed a knack for scene-setting and story-telling replete with poetic descriptions and insights. With each successive album it appears less likely that Springsteen will ever match those tales of urban lives and individual fortitude. For this outing, he's reduced to writing trivial nonsense in the guise of good-time rock 'n' roll on one hand and ponderous pomp on the other.

Springsteen's reliance on a limited vocabulary points up his artistic limitations. Out of 20 tracks, 13 use "night"; nine use "street" and there are four with "highway" and two with "avenue"; "drive" turns up in 10 songs, as does "heart." And these few words appear constantly throughout many of his previous songs as well. Repetitive language might be forgivable if the songs dealt with different subjects, but Springsteen just goes back over the same ground, neither refining nor elucidating --- merely restating.

All that said, I'm sincerely glad Springsteen exists. He's had a tremendous (and I think positive) effect on the rock community; fans, musicians and industry people have all been inspired by his work. His dedication, principles and heart have reawakened a lot of dormant enthusiasm among ex-rockers who thought themselves beyond the music's magic grip --- and that's no mean feat.

Disregarding overzealous fans and generally boring records, I respect Springsteen for proving you don't need to trade your soul for stardom (even if people try to do it for you). But that doesn't make The River a better record.

It's a clear sign of a stagnant talent who can't or won't dig himself out of the mud. That's a shame.
