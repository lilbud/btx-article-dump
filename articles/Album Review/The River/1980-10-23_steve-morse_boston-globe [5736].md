You keep wondering if Bruce Springsteen is going to waver, to slip out of control, to become jaded. You keep wondering if his creative well is going to run dry, his energy is going to slow down. And, once again, your wondering isneedless, because his new double-record set, "The River", is nothing less than his foremost career achievement. It is a remarkable distillation of the past 30 years of American pop music - from the dance mania of rockabilly to the soul of R&B; from the pathos of country to the electric stomp of modern rock 'n' roll.

Springsteen has his detractors - those who pigeonhole him for having written too much about cars and rebel-without-a-cause Sad Sacks - but on this new release he widens his scope as never before. He still hovers around bottled-up, working-class frustrations for his primary themes, but he also takes us on a twisting psychological journey, confronting us about our values, our relationships, our fantasies and our fears of being alone, anonymous and unloved. It is an excursion at once visually and poetically immediate, but with offshoots that linger deep in the subconscious.

Springsteen's last album, "Darkness on the Edge of Town", was a brooding, surprisingly downbeat (for him) search for solace and purpose. Since then we've waited 2 1/2 years for this new release, but it manages to uncannily merge the conflicting poles of his personality - the introspection of "Darkness" and the break-out euphoria of 1975's "Born to Run" LP.

This 20-song double-disk - which has been held up for months due to Springsteen's customarily fussy perfectionism - starts off with a heady dose of party-rock. "The Ties That Band" sets a Tom Petty/ Roger McGuinn pace; "Sherry Darling" is a frolicsome lecture about a lover's nosy mother (complete with background party noises like Dylan's "Rainy Day Women 12 & 35"); "Jackson Cage" is a wailing, backbeat-driven rocker about fighting claustrophobic lifestyles; and "Two Hearts" is a high-energy kicker where Springsteen the eternal romantic takes his bow: "Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind/ That's why I'll keep searching till I find my special one."

Less a storyteller this time than a mood-setter, Springsteen then offers the emotionally bracing "Independence Day", a ballad about a son's leaving home and father behind. Eloquent piano fills from Roy Bittan, and a church- organ style lament from Danny Federici of the E Street Band, complete the setting.

This is but the first of many extraordinary ballads that include the Eric Burdon-like "Fade Away" (about getting rejected by your lover and pleading "I don't wanna fade away ...I don't wanna be just another useless memory"); the sparsely textured "Stolen Car" (a heartrending look at lost love and the creeping anonymity that follows - "But I ride by night and I travel in fear/That in this darkness I will disappear"); and a treatise on the healing power of love, "Drive All Night" (with a sublime vocal recitation Otis Redding would be proud of).

Another pair of ballads shows Springsteen's awareness of country music subjects. The disarming title cut, "The River" (which he sang in the "No Nukes" concert film), talks of going to a river as an escape valve cum suicide site - a notion going back to Hank Williams' "Long Gone Lonesome Blues" from the '50s. Also, the song "Wreck on the Highway" is not only the same title as the old Roy Acuff country hit, but it also shares a similar helplessness at coming upon a highway fatality ("blood and glass" run together in Springsteen's view of the crash; "whiskey and blood" in the Acuff hit).

The ballads leave the deepest imprint, but the album is also rife with sturdy rockers, from the vibrant rush of "Cadillac Ranch", to the Spectorian wall-of- sound of "I'm a Rocker" and the Eddie- Cochran-meets-Sam-the-Sham dance feel of "Ramrod." In the hands of a lesser artist, all of this commingling of styles and themes would be a futile act of hubris, but in Springsteen's care it is grist for a masterpiece.
