Bruce Springsteen has confessed that he went for the brass ring on his best- selling "Born in the U.S.A." album of 1984. He wrote anthemic singalongs designed to ignite a mass audience. His aim was uncanny: The album sold 10 million copies and catapulted him into the airy realm of stadium superstar.

This runaway success apparently shook Springsteen to the core. His new album, "Tunnel of Love", which hits the stores tomorrow, is a radical shift from the rah-rah populism and pumped-up sound of "Born in the U.S.A." He turns to quiet, introspective love songs that might sound better in a coffeehouse than on an arena stage.

"Tunnel of Love" is a modest, acoustic-flavored album more appropriate for late-night romantic listening than overdrive on the dance floor. It is a tender collection of psychic etchings, as Springsteen grapples with the issues of success, relationships, marriage and, most acutely, the persistent self- doubt that nags him no matter how many million records he's sold.

The search for love is the objective here, not stardom. As Springsteen sings in the lead track, "Ain't Got You", which opens with a bluesy, a cappella vocal a la Brownie McGhee: I been around the world and all across the seven seas Been paid a king's ransom for doin' what comes naturally But I'm still the biggest fool, honey, this world ever knew 'Cause the only thing I ain't got, baby, I ain't got you.

By the last track, "Valentine's Day", Springsteen has found his baby and pledged his faith, but then looks on the flip side and realizes that "what scares me is losin' you." There are no easy solutions, nor easy moments of peace, on this album. Like his idol Hank Williams, Springsteen spins the simplest of melodies with the most unsettling of lyrical truths, helping make this a mature masterpiece. It may not be destined for eye-blinking commercial sales -- several tracks don't even have a drummer -- but it is sure evidence that Springsteen has not been jaded by celebrity.

"Music from the beginning always meant so much to me -- and the biggest fear was that in some way I was wasting people's time", Springsteen said in an interview in 1980. "In the end, you never answer those questions completely or fully, which is good, because once you do that, you get smug."

There's no smugness on "Tunnel of Love", not when one encounters a song such as "Two Faces", with an old-fashioned fuzz guitar sound and these lyrics: "I met a girl and we ran away/ I swore I'd make her happy every day/ And how I made her cry/ Two faces have I...One that laughs, one that cries/ One says hello, one says goodbye/ One does things I don't understand/ Makes me feel like half a man."

There are several reflective country songs reminiscent of his previous albums, "Nebraska" and "The River." The prettiest is "Tougher Than the Rest", about summoning the courage to ask a woman to dance. Springsteen plays a twangy guitar out of the songbooks of Waylon Jennings and Duane Eddy, ending with a wistful harmonica fade. And on the gentle "All That Heaven Will Allow", the album's most positive song about romance, a synthesizer simulates a Nashville pedal steel guitar.

In contrast to "Born in the U.S.A.", Springsteen's E Street Band takes a definite back seat on the new album. Springsteen handles most of the instruments -- what few there are -- by himself. His guitarist, Nils Lofgren, plays only one discernible solo, while saxophonist Clarence Clemons doesn't pick up his sax at all and only sings backup vocals. The recent low-key single, "Brilliant Disguise", is one of the few band-oriented songs on the album. Most of the time, the atmospherics comes from Springsteen's acoustic guitar and Roy Bittan's ethereally textured synthesizer. An example is the stately "Cautious Man", which describes a drifter named Billy who falls in love but can't shed his restless love of the road. Sings Springsteen in a haunting verse: "On the right hand Billy'd tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the word fear/ And in which hand he held his fate was never clear."

Not every song is an intense meditation, however. Conscious of his New Jersey roots, Springsteen sings in the title track of dating a girl in a local Jersey amusement park. He also adds the sound of a roller coaster in a brief touch of humor. But just as quickly comes the warning: "You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down through this tunnel of love."

The ride is a demanding one, but for experienced Springsteen fans who know him best as a songwriter and not a stadium icon, the ride is well worth taking.
