During each of Bruce Springsteen's marathon stadium concerts --- amid all the joy, conviction and chest-pounding rock grandeur --- there is always a bathroom song.

This is typically a newer track --- maybe something from 2009's "Working on a Dream" or 2012's "Wrecking Ball" --- where as soon as the audience realizes what it is, hundreds of fans stream into the aisles, hurrying off to the restroom or to snag one last beer before the remainder of the nearly four-hour extravaganza.

Everyone wins: the crowd gets a well-earned respite while Springsteen scratches the itch to play something actually written this century, even if it isn't a tune his diehards consider sacrosanct.

But what if The Boss composed an album almost entirely of "let me go pee real quick" triggers? Such is life on "Western Stars", Springsteen's highly anticipated and profoundly tedious new solo record --- the Jersey icon's most disappointing studio project in his nearly 50-year career.

The 13-track album released Friday (his first official LP in five years) perpetuates Springsteen's fascination with the disenfranchised of the American West, the same interest that spurred much of the thematic desolation present on fellow solo efforts, from "Devils and Dust" (2005) and "The Ghost of Tom Joad" (1995) all the way back to "Nebraska." Only this time Bruce has forgone the austere folk-rock for in favor of Glen Campbell's mollifying country-pop sound, specifically the lush orchestral arrangements that helped to define the Rhinestone Cowboy. The commitment to this style is absolute; "Western Stars" could double as the film score to a spaghetti western revival.

Galloping strings, cheerful horns and shuffling rhythms far removed from the crack of Max Weinberg's snare drum preside over most tracks. There are, to Springsteen and producer Ron Aniello's credit, genuinely sweeping moments here --- particularly on the jaunty "The Wayfarer" and the album's cresting lead single, "Hello Sunshine." But these big sky melodies do little to save the album from Springsteen's cloying embodiment of hitchhikers, cowboy movie stars and --- you guessed it --- hard-working men too distraught to sleep.

Since "The River", Springsteen has written himself into other characters" psyches and played first-person narrator, telling stories and juxtaposing them with his own emotional experiences. Few rockstars have ever been better in this respect, but here, Bruce playing John Wayne just feels like pablum, or at best a caricature of his far more compelling work on "Devils", which at least had allusions to the war in Iraq to solidify its raison d'Ãªtre.

But This time there is no discernible purpose, no new ground covered by the 69-year-old songwriter fresh off his glitzy Broadway run. Instead, Springsteen sings overblown lines like this one, from a new dirge called "Drive Fast (The Stuntman)": "At nineteen, I was the king of the dirt down at the Remington draw." If that's not a Springsteen lyric Mad Lib gone wrong, I'm not sure what is.

Most of the tracks here play like B-sides; only the jangling "Tucson Train" and soaring pop ballad "There Goes My Miracle" are perhaps worth a replay, while "Sleepy Joe's Cafe" and "Sundown" share all the appeal of two lanes blocked on the Parkway.

To boot, the highly affected drawl Springsteen has adopted in dribs and drabs over the years --- as early as "Nebraska" --- is now more prevalent than ever, stretching phrases like "5:15", sung on "Tucson Train", into "fah-ve fif- tain." Maybe the twang further endears The Boss to his southern faithful, but I'll bet more than a few New Jersey fans will find this latest boot-and-saddle persona particularly inauthentic. The longer the man lives on a multi-million- dollar horse farm in affluent Colts Neck, the more difficult it becomes to imagine him blowing in from town to town, sauntering down dirt roads with a ol' six string slung over his shoulder.

"Western Stars" is, ultimately, a tumbleweed. It's here for a few moments, but soon to be gone and forgotten, swept away by the howling wind that's already begun to swirl around the news that Springsteen will record with The E Street Band this fall and then head back on the road for a full-band concert tour in 2020.

With such a busy schedule, Springsteen has no current plans to tour in support of "Western Stars."

And for that, we should be grateful.
