Contractual disputes kept Springsteen out of the studio for a couple of years. So when he bounced back after two years of intensive touring he had hardened his performance and honed his professionalism. The lyrics of these new songs were written from a more mature viewpoint -- teenage obsessions replaced by a working man's concerns. Another Jimmy Iovine/Record Plant recording, Darkness is far tighter and "shifts gear" so much more easily than Born to Run. The deliberate padding out of the sound is no longer indulged in and the recording sets out to capture the band straight-head on.

Springsteen's screaming delivery in a song like "Adam Raised a Cain" is still robbed of much of its impact by the relatively two-dimensional recording. The density of sound leaves the album without ebb and flow.
