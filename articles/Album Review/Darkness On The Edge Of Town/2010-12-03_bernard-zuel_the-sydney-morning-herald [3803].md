Every album comes with a parallel universe in which the choice of different songs/sounds/emotions could have created another reality, another equally valid "definitive statement".

It's one reason why many of us love box sets, with their unreleased/alternate songs. It's also why this massive collection is nigh on essential. It includes three CDs (the remastered album and two discs of unreleased material) and three DVDs (a fascinating documentary, a somewhat flat 2009 performance of the album alongside more enjoyable rehearsal/recording footage from 1976-'78 and a typically exhilarating '78 concert) packaged in a reproduction of one of Springsteen's famous spiral notebooks (containing notes, plans, lyrics and lists).

It's important to understand the context of Darkness on the Edge of Town. In 1975, Springsteen compressed his style into translatable pop songs on Born to Run, scoring huge success by making euphoric-sounding tales of narrow horizons seem universal. He became a legitimate star.

Almost immediately he became embroiled in legal action with his first manager, which prevented him from even entering a recording studio. During more than two years of litigation, Springsteen could do little more than write (some 60 songs), rehearse and simultaneously begin figuring out exactly what kind of artist he wanted to be.

The answer, as the vividly captured characters in the sober-minded but passionately felt Darkness on the Edge of Town show, was someone more connected to the small towns he grew up in, more in tune with the lives of those he saw, more reflective of the less-than-euphoric mood of the country amid what president Jimmy Carter called its "malaise".

Many of the unreleased songs were set aside not because they weren't good but because they couldn't fit in with this concept. If they had come out in '76 or early '77, immediately in the wake of Born to Run, songs such as the girl group romance of Gotta Get That Feeling and its sibling Ain't Good Enough For You, the Orbison homages of Outside Looking in and Wrong Side of the Street and the punchy pop of Talk to Me would have made a fine album you'd still be hearing on radio now. But by 1978 they weren't where Springsteen's head was at. Likewise Fire (later done by the Pointer Sisters) and Because the Night (added to and recorded by Patti Smith) felt too much like personal pop songs rather than stories of "real" lives.

The notable exception among the unreleased songs is The Promise, which in its tale of frustrated dreams and burning, if contained, anger done in an almost hymnal setting would have (and maybe should have) slid on to Darkness perfectly, except that Springsteen felt it too self-referential.

Darkness is a great album on its own, an essential point in one of the great careers. This box doesn't change or add to that album but it does expand the world around it in ways that any fan would revel in.
