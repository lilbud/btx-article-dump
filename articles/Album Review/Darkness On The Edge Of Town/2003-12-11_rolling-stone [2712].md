"When I was making this particular album, I just had a specific thing in mind", Springsteen told Rolling Stone. "It had to be just a relentless...just a barrage of that particular thing." That obsession was the aftermath of the epic romanticism of his first three records: songs about people struggling with collapsed dreams. This was tough music, inspired by tough movies by Sergio Leone and John Ford. Recorded after a long absence from the studio (due to a lawsuit against his former manager), Springsteen and the E Street Band played rockers such as "Badlands" and "Promised Land" with barely contained passion.

Darkness on the Edge of Town was chosen as the 151st greatest album of all time by the editors of Rolling Stone magazine in Dec. 2003.
