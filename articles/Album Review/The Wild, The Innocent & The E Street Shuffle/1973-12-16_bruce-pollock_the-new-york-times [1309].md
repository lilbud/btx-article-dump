Springsteen Celebrates Street Life

WHEN BRUCE Springsteen's first Columbia album, Greetings From Asbury Park, came out almost a year ago, it was met with the most extravagant and outrageous praise I've ever encountered in the Rock Press. Reviewers compared him to Bob Dylan, The Band, Van Morrison, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, El Topo, Webster's New World Dictionary. If superlatives were a dime a dozen, Springsteen could have retired then and there.

Because of the amazing way he broke from the gate, even his most avid fans wondered how he could possibly sustain the pace. He'd never be able to follow his own act! Meanwhile, the cynical suspected a paper legend that would come apart at the first drop of split milk. Springsteen would have to do it again before they would believe.

Now, after five solid months of dedicated labor, that second piece of work is here - The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle (Columbia KC 32432) - and in an era of diminishing returns, false prophets and false bottoms, where the best of our instant pop-up superstars are either choked-off, laid-back, lame or laid out flat, it is with a great sense of relief that I announce to the disbelievers that Bruce Springsteen has delivered another stone, howling, joyous monster of a record. Of course the fanatics knew the issue was never really in doubt.

Springsteen is a word virtuoso, who uses language the way his band-mate Clarence Clemons plays the sax: tough, fast and funky, sometimes frivolous, often devastating. His lyrics are intuitive, emotional, a mass of flung images that spin toward you from all directions and somehow hang on a canvas - great swatches of local color that blend into a landscape of remembered adolescent scenes and dreams in the swamps and seasides of Jersey, in the slums of New York.

In a time when everyone else is leaving the city for greener pastures, Springsteen celebrates street life, rendering it completely imagined, with places and names - Crazy Janey, Wild Billy, Rosalita. His vision is absolutely authentic; there's no doubting that he lives in that world of hoods and hitters, sinners, studs and saints. He is Jersey's Hubert Selby only younger and less defeated by life.

But the true gift of the album is the music. The Springsteen Six - Clarence Clemons on sax, Danny Federici on organ and accordion, Gary Tallent on bass and tuba, Vinnie Lopez on drums and David Sancious on piano and Bruce on guitar - can play anything from a circus march to a classical dirge, often within the borders of the same piece. The album is a mad excursion from rhythm and blues edged in jazz to rock and roll touched with folk and funk; it swings like crazy, it drives home the torrent of his words to perfection. Each piece (you can't really call them "songs") is a world in itself, any one alone worth the price of the album.

IN THE WILD, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle we start out by doing 'The E Street Shuffle', which takes place on the updated West Side of the Jets and the Sharks, in a speedy r&b tempo. From there it's over to Asbury Park to visit Sandy and to experience the carnival summertime, penny arcade life on and below the boardwalk. 'Kitty's Back', is a street scene reminiscent of Kerouac's be-bop prosody, the endless sad jazz night of America, done in miniature by Springsteen's crew of romantic loners and losers. 'Wild Billy's Circus Story' is an incredible work which ends the side - a contemporary vision of a traveling tent show... "God save the human cannon-ball..."

'Incident on 57th Street' and 'New York City Serenade' again take place in the bowels of Manhattan, and both sizzle like Eighth Avenue in August. Here are images of hustlers in leather jackets, huddled against the wind, cigarettes flickering in the violent night, and their dungaree molls, Crazy Janey, Diamond Jackie. 'Rosalita', which occurs between those two creations, is a wild, brawling bash, a precise and exuberant picture of teenage romance in the seventies. Springsteen's cast of characters, including himself, are easy to know and to like. They are determined to win you over and they will, and so will the album.

The selections are neither too long nor too loud, have none of the excesses Springsteen has been known to sometimes display live. In fact, the album leaves you wishing it would go on forever. Every time Springsteen comes to town, all his friends flock to see him. This album should increase their number immeasurably.

Can you imagine what his third album will be like?
