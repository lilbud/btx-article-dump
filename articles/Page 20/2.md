Let's start with the obvious. Bruce Springsteen is a tremendous talent, and he really knows how to lead a rock'n' roll band. Birmingham was fortunate enough to get a date on Springsteen's tour to support his latest album, "The Rising", and Tuesday's 8:30 p.m. show two-and-a-half hours long and 23 songs full lived up to his reputation as committed, charismatic hall of famer.

The Boss was in charge all the way, from the surging opening number to the final, muscular encore. As guitarist Nils Lofgren said, Springsteen gives 100 percent from his command post on stage, backed by the powerful team known as the E Street Band. Too bad that about half of the seats were empty in the arena's upper tier, which means that several thousand fans missed out on an exciting evening of honest, authentic, hard-played American music.

As expected, about half of the set list was devoted to "The Rising", a CD that offers heartfelt commentary on the aftermath of the Sept. 11 tragedies.

Springsteen, 53, doesn't slap you in the face with patriotism in these songs; he provides subtle observations that have the ring of truth. He's at his best when describing the particular, telling stories about everyday people that stir up universal emotions. Superior examples of this skill were offered on Tuesday night, in tunes such as "You're Missing", "Empty Sky", "Into the Fire", "Lonesome Day" and the mournfully beautiful "My City of Ruins." If you weren't on the floor, in the special general-admission area up front, you really needed to look at the large video screens on the sides of the stage during these moments. Springsteen's face, raw with feeling, was displayed there in moving close-up.

While the poignancy of "The Rising" provided a sad, sweet touchstone for the performance, Springsteen would never turn any show of his into a funeral dirge. There was upbeat material aplenty, including "Dancing in the Dark", "Glory Days", "Darlington County", "Badlands", "She's the One", "Cadillac Ranch" and "Born to Run." A couple of new songs, "Waiting on a Sunny Day" and "Mary's Place", upheld and expanded the party mood. Springsteen also counted off the crowd pleaser "Bobby Jean" and surprised the audience by bringing up Birmingham native Emmylou Harris for a duet on "My Hometown."

The E Street Band sounded typically strong, although saxophone player Clarence Clemons appeared more tentative and less flamboyant than usual. It's likely that he's still recovering from a recent bout of eye surgery, though, and the other nine band members (especially guitarists Steven Van Zandt and Lofgren) more than took up the slack.

Springsteen proved to be such a dynamic showman, his band introductions (reminiscent of a gospel preacher) seemed like an event to savor. Throughout the performance, he thrilled fans by tossing a microphone into the crowd, jumping on a piano, sliding the length of the stage and allowing folks down front to play his guitar en masse. The next band to hit the BJCC certainly has a tough act to follow. So why three and a half stars instead of four? Well, not even Springsteen could live up to the massive hype surrounding his hotly anticipated concerts. This wasn't a transcendent religious experience, just an amazingly good show.
