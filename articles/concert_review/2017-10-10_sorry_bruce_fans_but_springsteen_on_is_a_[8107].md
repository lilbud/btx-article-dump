NEW YORK -- Inside the Walter Kerr Theatre -- a modest playhouse of just 960 red velvet seats -- Bruce Springsteen could sing without a microphone.

On Tuesday evening, The Boss stood on the stage's edge as he belted his stormy tune "The Promised Land" over an audience that hummed with adoration: some fans whisper-sang along; others sat in full-on rock n' roll arrest, staring in reverence at the man strumming his sunburst Takamine guitar. A dramatic crimson light cast half his face in shadow, mimicking the southwest's unforgiving heat. Springsteen had just finished recounting his first cross- country road trip -- a three-day marathon in 1971 that forced Bruce, who had never driven before, to speed halfway across the U.S. for an audition in California.

If that story sounds familiar, that's because it is; the same tale was told with nearly identical detail in Springsteen's autobiography "Born To Run"released last fall.

For all its fevered anticipation, "Springsteen on Broadway" is largely two hours of this: Springsteen tells a version of an anecdote many fans already know -- virtually every bit of monologue in the production's story-then-song pattern appeared first in the memoir -- and then he plays a tune, mostly hits and fan favorites, from the thick catalog.

The pacing isn't so atypical of past Springsteen theater performances, only now his listeners are physically closer, both to him and the austere, brick- backed stage, adorned only with a few piles of black-and-metal roadie boxes and a baby grand piano. Bruce wears an equally muted gray t-shirt and pants.

Sorry to break the bad news, Bruce fans, but Springsteen's choice to develop this four-month residency in New York by himself, without the help of a stage- savvy director, has proven a cavalier and foolish decision by the rock icon -- the arc of this disjointed production is saved only by its music and the exclusivity of its venue. He would've saved himself some trouble simply rocking a straight, two-hour acoustic set and selling his audiobook with the candy and cocktails.

While Springsteen's humble candor scores a few laughs -- "I have never held an honest job in my entire life. I have never done any hard labor, yet it is all I have written about" yuk, yuk -- his life story is front-loaded with New Jersey beginnings, (if you hail from Monmouth County, all the Freehold and Asbury Park name-dropping is familiar and fun), but then ignores huge swaths of his incredible career.

Springsteen narrates his blue-collar childhood -- pulling his father out of the local bars, renting his first guitar because his family couldn't purchase one outright -- and moves onto his forming the E Street Band in Asbury Park, which climaxes on a fine, piano-only version of "10th Avenue Freeze-Out" and a rousing tribute to late saxophonist Clarence Clemons.

At this point the crowd could no longer withhold its idolatry and began to cheer wildly and clap to the beat.

But from shorefront Monmouth County the plot leaps to a general profession of love for wife and E Street Band member Patti Scialfa, who rather unnecessarily joins Bruce on stage, adding little more than harmonies to two songs before disappearing having never uttered a word.

Some vagaries about the country's political climate follow-- Springsteen calls it "just a bad chapter in the ongoing battle for the soul of our nation" -- and a handful more songs close out the night, with less and less spoken word breaking them up, as if Bruce wished to button up his prose once and for all and just get on with the music already. After all, inside his usual three to four-hour stadium marathons, the first two hours are merely a warmup.

And that's what "Springsteen on Broadway" felt like: some sort of one-off storyteller session for fan club members -- something to get him loosened for an upcoming tour -- not a show he'll play five times a week from now through Feb. 3.

I left "Springsteen on Broadway" wondering what Bruce actually created here, besides increased visibility for Ticketmaster's polarizing new Verified Fan selection method, and a celebration of his most affluent supporters in a ritzy Broadway setting his working-man characters couldn't begin to afford.

Sure, there is an inherent intimacy many fans will never experience again, and sonically the show was brilliant; the warm acoustics of the Walter Kerr were undoubtedly a selling point for Bruce and every note rang out rich and true.

Pared back arrangements of "Thunder Road" and a triumphant rendition of "Land of Hope and Dreams" were particularly memorable.

But if you know Springsteen's life well or have read his new book, this two- hour performance offers nothing new about the man, other than a few musings on his career en masse, as if he was planning to hang up his guitar straps in the near future: "This I have presented to you as my long, noisy prayer, as my magic trick", Springsteen said. "I wanted to rock your very soul and have you pass it on. ... I hope I have been a good traveling companion."

Perhaps most disappointing is the fact that Springsteen's entire script is laid out before him on teleprompters, hanging from the mezzanine, on the stage floor and at his piano. Yes, Bruce is no actor and there is a heap of text to memorize, but still, some of the seamless Broadway mystique was lost here. At times it felt like he was reading a rigidly prepared speech.

Over the next four months there will be droves of super-fans who will likely find no fault with this performance and consider the hefty ticket price worth every penny. But if you are a grounded listener who was curious how Springsteen's shtick would translate to theater, you may be facing a river of buyer's remorse.
