WORCESTER -- Bruce Springsteen still plays marathon, three-hour-length shows.

That's no surprise. But the surprise on his latest tour is just how much he's shaking those shows up from night to night. He's adding songs, subtracting songs, changing arrangements and generally keeping new and old fans happily off guard.

Springsteen, who opened a two-show stand at the Worcester Centrum last night, has now mixed in 29 different songs from the 28 songs he performed when his stateside tour began three weeks ago.

"We just played New Jersey for 11 nights, and I was pulling out everything I could", Springsteen said with a laugh yesterday afternoon at the Centrum.

"There's a basic structure to the set, but I want enough room in it so it doesn't get embalmed. I want to keep it exciting for the musicians and for myself."

Before the tour, Springsteen had promised to stress newer tunes from his latest albums, "Human Touch" and "Lucky Town", but suddenly a lot of chestnuts like "Rosalita", "I'm on Fire", "Badlands" "Spirit in the Night" and "Darlington County" are starting to creep in.

"I'm choosing whatever feels right", said Springsteen after a sound check. "I want to recontextualize the old songs with the new material. And I'm pulling a lot from the 'Darkness' album, because it fits in well at the moment, especially with the mood of the country." (Springsteen's "Darkness on the Edge of Town" album came out in the late '70s after a turbulent period in his career.) Springsteen's latest tour, his first in four years, also features a new band that has occasionally been criticized as not up to par with his previous E Street Band. Springsteen said he's heard the criticisms, but doesn't buy them.

"The E Street Band was one of the best bands in the world", he said. "I've known some of those guys for 20 years. They're just a great, great band. I've loved all those guys. I couldn't ask for better musicians. But I'm very confident in every player I have onstage now. It's a good band."

Springsteen said he was looking for something different in his new band, a young unit that stars guitarist Shane Fontayne (formerly of Lone Justice) and drummer Zachary Alford (formerly of the B-52's). The only E Street holdover is keyboardist Roy Bittan.

"I want to push the edges out a little bit", he explained about the new band.

"I want to maintain the richness and sound and color of the past, and maintain the R & B feel. But I want more gospel and a harder-edged, guitar-driven sound. And really, I think we're just scraping the surface so far."

As for the future, Springsteen said he hopes to play New England again before the tour ends. He also hopes to shorten his tours, but do more of them, as his career continues. "I've been out on tours for a year, but that's too long", he said. "I also want to get more albums out. I'm looking for a steadier beat overall."
