BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN at the Worcester Centrum through tonight

WORCESTER -- If there are any doubting Thomases left on the topic of Bruce Springsteen, then please refer them to last night's rocket-launching display.

Lighting up the boards from start to finish, Springsteen reclaimed his glory days with a sweeping blast of high-flying "rock & soul", to use his words.

He was again a man possessed, singing into the wee hours (until midnight, at least) and wrenching every drop of emotion from his new band, from himself and from the 14,500 fans, some of whom may have come with some skepticism, but no doubt left with their loyalty renewed.

Last night was a quantum leap from the erratic tour opener that this writer caught at the Meadowlands in New Jersey three weeks ago. Springsteen was confident throughout, discovering a rhythmic flow and riding it for all it was worth, right back to the absolute pinnacle of rock performance.

Above all, his new band, awkward at that first outing, has coalesced proudly, finding their own identity and sound after a lot of invidious comparisons to Springsteen's bygone E Street Band. The new unit, led by metal-ready guitarist Shane Fontane and workhorse drummer Zachary Alford (a much more lively presence last night), now gives Springsteen the freedom to do just about any song from his 20-year repertoire, which is exactly what he did.

Dressed like a prairie preacher in a black, baggy suit and vest, Springsteen opened up with the unrecorded "Red-Headed Woman" (a paean to his wife, Patti Scialfa), then ripped into three new songs, "Better Days", "Local Hero" (going down on bended knee like James Brown) and "Lucky Town", a guitar raveup that showed Springsteen to be more of a guitarslinger than ever before. (He takes more solos that were once taken by saxophonist Clarence Clemons.) Springsteen's first 90-minute set was filled with resonant combinations of songs. In heartfelt fashion, he strung together the oldies "Darkness on the Edge of Town" (where he hit an Ella Fitzgerald-like high note that shook the walls) and an acoustic "Spirit in the Night", with gospel harmonies from his six backup singers. But the best string was Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped" (with a stop-and-start drama framed by stunning computer lighting effects), a wonderfully edgy "Badlands" and the redemption of "Living Proof", about the birth of his son, Evan James, now 2.

The set ended with a thrilling bar-band R&B segment, as singer Bobby King came forward for "Man's Job" and "Roll of the Dice." But after a 40-minute intermission, they all returned for nearly two more hours, pumping through more new tracks (the only mishap was a faltering "Book of Dreams"), together with stratosphere-bound classics like "Glory Days", "Born to Run", "Because the Night", "Thunder Road", "Born in the USA" and "Brilliant Disguise", with Scialfa on harmony. No doubt about it. Springsteen was back in full glory.
