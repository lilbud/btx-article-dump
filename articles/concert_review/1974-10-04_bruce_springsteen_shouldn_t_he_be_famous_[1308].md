IT WAS DIFFICULT to tell just when the stage caved in. It seemed to happen during 'Rosalita', the last song before the encore. But maybe that's just when the crush of Bruce Springsteen fans seeking to touch their hero began.

Whenever it started, by the time the show was over, the success of Springsteen's first concert at Avery Fisher Hall in New York could be measured visibly. In the orchestra pit, collapsed and demolished, lay the front three feet of the stage. The weight of the crowd had snapped it from its moorings.

Fortunately, no one was hurt.

Bruce who?

Bruce Springsteen, the young singer-songwriter from Asbury Park, NJ who many people feel is going to be the greatest new rock star of the seventies. With his mangy beard, and his greasy hair, he reminds many of that other symbol of alienation, James Dean. Dressed in an inevitably sleeveless T-shirt and mirror sunglasses no matter how dark the hall, Springsteen, playing guitar and singing, is the most mesmerizing rock performer to emerge since Bette Midler.

But of course, his appeal, like his appearance, is antithetical to Midler's.

When Springsteen chooses an old hit to perform, he'll reach for Sam Cooke's 'Cupid', or the Crystals 'Then I Kissed Him', or perhaps Gary US Bonds"

'Quarter To Three'. When he wants a new song, he'll write it himself, with a sense of rhythmic invention and a penchant for weird guitar lines that makes him a match for even those masters of the musically macabre, Steely Dan.

Springsteen has been recording and performing in the national eye since 1972\.

In that time, he's been compared, at one time or another, and with varying degrees of seriousness, to Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and Van Morrison. And even though his two albums, Greetings From Asbury Park, NJ and The Wild, The Innocent And The E Street Shuffle, have only sold about 100,000 copies between them, the response that he elicits is akin to fanaticism. When his first single, 'Blinded By The light', was released, Clive Davis, then president of Columbia Records, stood up at a company meeting and read the lyrics, verbatim, aloud. When he made an appearance in Boston last spring, Rolling Stone record- review editor Jon Landau, ordinarily given to cynicism, wrote, "I have just seen rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen." When he played Avery Fisher Hall Oct. 4, I watched a rock critic who hadn't bought a concert seat in years pay for a ticket and come out beaming.

Why? Because Bruce Springsteen, as much as any other rock and roll waif who's come down the pike in this decade, can make you feel that rock music has a future. He can do everything. He writes lyrics that put Dylan's recent work to shame, evoking the seedy pastures of southern New Jersey and the dark criminal environments of his Manhattan haunts with an off-hand sense of wonder. He is wantonly sexual, physically imposing, though he is of diminutive stature. His hips, like Presley's, tell the tale. When he mimes one of his improbable tales of adolescent passion, he does so more provocatively than David Bowie or any of the other heralded practitioners of rock theatre. He is a perfectly choreographed rhythm machine, who duck walks like Chuck Berry and mugs like Dylan in his early, Chaplinesque days.

Springsteen is also an impressive guitar player. He steps out to introduce a new song, and says, with utter arrogance, "You don't mess around with a beat like this. It makes good girls bad and bad girls worse." Scarily enough, when he plays the Bo Diddley-inflected 'She's The One', good girls all around get bad, and bad ones worse.

The fact that he has one of the most dynamic rock bands in the world is an aid. His sax player, Clarence Clemmons is the most soulful horn player since the demise of King Curtis. The recently departed pianist, David Sancious, used to add Mozart quotations to the second album's masterpiece, 'New York City Serenade.' His replacement is no slouch either. When a gunshot is called for, the drummer adds it. And in a touch of pure bluster, the group now features a slight, blonde female violinist. But Springsteen dominates, a ball of energy who can play for more than two hours, as he did at his Fisher concert, with no noticeable letup.

Of course, if Springsteen is that good, shouldn't he be famous? There is a variety of explanations for his lack of commercial success, the most plausible being that his recordings have been poorly produced. On both, the drumming (with a drummer not now in the group) is feeble, and the sound is less than it ought to be. The answer, some suggest, is a live recording, a device that worked for the Allman Brothers, another group that was hailed long before it made it to the top.

Of course, nothing less than the top will do for Springsteen. His songs are filled with characters with no way out, and his new single, should it ever be released, is called 'Born To Lose'. But depicting sleazy losers isn't just a way of celebrating decadence for Springsteen. His losers are like the young prizefighters in the old movies, who had their choices laid out clearly for them. Springsteen has made his bargain, too, and it stands as either his motto or epitaph depending on the way things turn out. The advice rumbles from his masterpiece, 'New York City Serenade'. "Walk tall or don't walk at all." Bruce Springsteen holds his head high.
