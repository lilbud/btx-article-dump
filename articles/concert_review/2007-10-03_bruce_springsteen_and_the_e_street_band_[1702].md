There are few American musical acts--or, for that matter, many rock-and-roll bands anywhere--that have matured as well as New Jersey's Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. As the body of Springsteen's work grows, each progressive offering seems to take on its own ageless quality, drawing from rhythms, chord progressions, keyboard lines and guitar leads that often ring out with passing familiarity.

But by the time The Boss puts his final lyrical stamps on each number, shakes and bakes them in rehearsal, and rolls them out for audience consumption, they become distinctive trademarks, unmistakable even to those claiming to not be fans. And what honest music lovers, particularly live music fans, could summarily reject Springsteen and company, especially if his Tuesday (10/2) tour opener in Hartford, CT, is any evidence of what he and his crew are still capable of delivering?

Springsteen's often-blistering two-hour-plus set was heavy on new material from "Magic", his latest original recording with the E Street Band, which was released the day of the show. In fact, anyone who bought or downloaded the album earlier in the day heard all but three of the new numbers live a few hours later (see setlist below).

Jammed in between the new material were some of the most inspiring tunes from 2002's "The Rising": "Lonesome Day", was dished up early and was nearly as well-received as the classic song "The Ties That Bind", which preceded it; "The Rising", which came mid-set; and "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" performed during the encore.

Burning up those 11 tunes left precious little time for any nuggets for the long-time fans--many of whom SoundSpike spoke with--who came from distant states and even the UK, to catch Springsteen's tour opener at the Hartford Civic Center.

The classic material that managed to find its way to the surface from deeper in The Boss' catalog did elicit the kind of roaring tribute one might expect, even though die-hard Springsteen concert-goers knew several of the songs to be all too frequent stand-bys, arguably overplayed a few years ago on the extended tour for "The Rising."

Where "The Promised Land" and "Darkness On the Edge of Town" were about the most pedestrian of the show, "Night", into "She's the One", reaffirmed that this act is virtually impossible to beat for sheer vitality and inspired collaboration. "Darlington County" and the final encore number, the Irish Reel "American Land", were among the most spirited, while "Reason to Believe" was transformed into a chugging blues number.

Although The Boss is quite adept at conducting the band with the slightest flick of his Fender Telecaster, "Reason to Believe" and "Gypsy Biker", in particular, showcased Springsteen's harmonica work and an emerging new stage presence utilizing that tiny instrument.

He undoubtedly honed this aspect of his live act during the solo "Devils and Dust" and "The Seeger Sessions" tours, because the Hartford show saw Springsteen harping away like a veteran bluesman, putting his whole body into the wheezing and honking which in turn further energized both the band and the crowd.

Springsteen's first new single, "Radio Nowhere", served as the show's opening number . And, while it sounds very fresh and young on the album, the live showcase gave The Boss an opportunity to crank up the song's inherent edginess even a few more notches.

Among other live high points from "Magic" were the haunting "Devil's Arcade", while "Long Walk Home" and "Livin' in the Future" gave sax man Clarence Clemons two opportunities to really shine. "Born to Run" remained an encore highlight, during which all the house lights were fired up so the band could share in the exuberance with every member of the audience, from those singing along standing in front of the stage, to those dancing among the most far- flung cheap seats.

As the tour moves across the country, those in attendance will likely look back on Springsteen's Hartford tour opener as the fan-filled love fest it was meant to be, a not-so-final stand that proved The Boss and The E Street Band are aging but not growing old.

While the newest recorded material certainly can't compare to classics like "Born to Run" and "The River", it far outweighs a number of other Springsteen offerings, and deserves a chance to be heard in concert--even if it is at the expense of not trotting out a few more obscure classics from earlier days.
