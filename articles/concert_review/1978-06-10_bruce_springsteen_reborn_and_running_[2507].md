EVEN BEFORE the two brilliant concerts at the Spectrum earlier in the week, Bruce Springsteen could have been the Mayor of Philadelphia if he had ever decided to campaign.

I arrived at the Spectrum two hours before showtime, looking for a burger stand and a chance to talk with ticket holders on their way to Springsteen's long-sold-out shows.

I chatted with a guy named Dave, who works in a record and tape retail outlet in South Philadelphia, and explained Springsteen's drawing power in this Eastern city: "The first day 'Born To Run' was released it sold 20,000 copies and another 20,000 copies the next day."

Local FM station WMR first broke Springsteen five years ago when his Greetings From Asbury Park NJ album was issued. Bruce and his band have been big in this city long before the rest of the United States and the world.

In the next few months, Springsteen and Co. will play 75 concerts before a planned trip to Europe and England in the autumn.

I'll say this now: I've probably seen 2,000 concerts and club dates over the last 20 years. Based on the two performances I attended in this city by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, I would rank them right at the top of my all-time check list.

The two-and-a-half hour programme is awesome. Springsteen keeps getting better with age and the E Street Band are just as arresting.

When Bruce Springsteen comes to Philadelphia it's an event, not a concert. He played the Spectrum in 1976 and his return to this site is greeted with the same expectations one associates with the Rolling Stones, without the drugs or arrests.

LAST MONTH I was walking down Santa Monica Bvld in West Hollywood, waiting for the light to change at the Sweetzer intersection and I noticed a familiar figure hoofing it down the pavement. It was Bruce Springsteen.

We chatted for a while, talked a bit about his new album, which he was mixing in LA, and as usual he was very friendly and warm.

I've seen this guy play 15 times over the last five years. From his legendary Troubadour club date to the cosmic Roxy stint in October 1975, he always dazzles.

And I've got to thank Kim Fowley for taking me to my initial Springsteen concert in 1973 at the Ahmanson Theatre, where Clive Davis hosted the Week To Remember concert series.

At the time Kim was writing songs for The New Riders Of The Purple Sage, who shared the bill with Springsteen that evening. I'll never forget Springsteen doing 'Wild Billy's Circus', and the CBS executive leaning over across the aisle and whispering to Kim: "What do ya think of this guy? Some of these words are from Mars."

And in true Fowley tradition, Kim replied: "I wish I had his publishing on any planet."

The record company employee laughed and later that night I told the story to Clive Davis, who treated us like royalty for the rest of the engagement.

Springsteen's catalogue has charted very well in the US. The Hollies covered 'Sandy', Manfred Mann hit number one with 'Blinded By The Light', and Greg Kihn ('For You'), Patti Smith ('Because The Night'), and Robert Gordon ('Fire') have all benefited by Springsteen's songs. Bruce is even on the next Dictators album in a cameo role, just like he's on the latest Lou Reed album.

The point is, Bruce Springsteen always delivers. He helps people get on the chart, or get back on the chart, as well as giving some of the best rock 'n' roll concerts available on the circuit. And he's so unassuming.

Getting back to the street corner on Santa Monica Bvld. I asked him about the live gigs he was starting at the end of the month. "It's gonna be hot", he mentioned. He was modest. The gigs were as hot as Las Vegas in August.

We parted, and I ran into him that night at the Starwood where Blondie were playing. He was watching with the people on the floor and not sitting in the reserved section upstairs.

Knowing him, he probably paid to get in and didn't even bother going through the VIP entrance. I offered him a ride back to his hotel at 2.30 am but he politely declined, opting to walk down the street.

ANOTHER thing that impresses me about the Philadelphia Springsteen concerts is that everyone knows the names of all the band members. It's like a baseball team, where people have followed the progress of the players since they hit the big leagues.

On stage, the band are so passionate and energetic, I sometimes think they are the best kept secret in showbiz. Bruce and the E Streeters use tools and roots from the Fifties and Sixties, but the topics and themes explored in the songs have such a contemporary veneer.

And, unlike a lot of entertainers who mouth off in the music press about nationalistic zeal, this is one person who is so American that he'll present a real image of America which the press always hides from the people.

A Springsteen performance is a dramatic rock 'n' roll show which one never tires of.

Roy Bittan's piano work has graced Bowie's Station To Station, the Peter Gabriel solo album and the Meat Loaf album. Bittan is a fine piano player.

The sound mix for a Springsteen concert is remarkable: you can hear all the piano notes without straining.

After the first night, I had a chance to speak to Roy. "It's unbelievable playing again. Feels great. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel."

Another impressive addition to the Springsteen sound is organist Danny Federici. His playing reminds me of Stevie Winwood and it's ironic to find out from bassist Garry Tallent that before Federici joined the band, they used to do a live rendition of 'Gimme Some Lovin", the Spencer Davis song.

Danny does very few solos in the show, but is a functional player who offers well-defined passages and, like the rest of the band, doesn't fall into the trap of egotism. This is team work on display.

Danny was also quite pleased by the Philadelphia fan reaction "Bruce has always been popular here, even before I joined the band. He dedicated 'For You' to the audience tonight. They have been with him from the start."
