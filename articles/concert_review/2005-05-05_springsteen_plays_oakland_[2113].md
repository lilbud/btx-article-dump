It's a rare rock 'n' roll artist who can play a solo acoustic set of more than two hours and make it feel almost as electric as when he is plugged in.

Bruce Springsteen did it at Oakland's Paramount Theater Thursday night, receiving thunderous ovations from a sold out audience.

Shuffling instruments and reworking songs, he ran through a sort of lesser- known greatest hits set, some of them set in such brilliant disguises it took an expert to decipher what he was playing.

After starting with "My Beautiful Reward", from 1992's less than stellar, "Lucky Town", he sang a song and accompanied himself only on harmonica, vocals and music through a distorted effects processor.

It sounded like an old Muddy Waters take on "Mannish Boy", but turned out to be ``Reason to Believe", from 1982's first acoustic effort, "Nebraska."

Later in the show he used the same muddy technique for that album's "Johnny 99."

He played a 12-string guitar and made it sound like an entire band on "All the Way Home" and did a call and response on "The Rising" that sounded like two people were singing.

He reworked show closer "Promised Land" into something that could have been played by an ancient Mississippi Delta blues shouter, pounding on the guitar rather than strumming it.

Some highlights included emotional solo piano takes on "Racing in the Streets" and "The River."

There was a handful of new songs from ``Devils & Dust" that worked perfectly in an acoustic context. And even better, songs from his last album, "The Rising", including "Further on (Up the Road)", lost no power with the power down.

How many other classic rock artists are putting out great work 35 years into their careers? Not many.

Everytime out Springsteen has distinguised himself with perfect sound systems that defy the constraints of the worst rooms. That wasn't a problem at the Paramount, but he still managed to make the sound full and rich and never too loud.

It makes you wonder why so few other artists can achieve the same satisfying results. Are they too cheap or too ignorant to spend the time and money to make live shows sound as good as recordings?

That said, Springsteen was not without his errors onstage. There were plenty of minor clunkers on the piano and harmonica, particularly odd since his three-hour-long arena shows with the large E Street Band were almost compulsively note perfect.

But Thursday was his night to be a folkie, ala Woody Guthrie, the blemishes adding to the nights down-home reality.

The artist who looks far younger than his 55 years, asked the audience not to clap along, fearing it would throw off his "tenuous" sense of rhythm. He also asked them to stop clapping at the beginning of songs.

"You can eschew the clapping when you recognize a song", he said, perhaps the first rocker in history to use that S.A.T. word onstage. "I know it and you've heard it before. It's kind of a hack thing. It'd been done. I feel like I'm in Vegas when I hear that clapping."

He even asked them not to applaud his few political statements, such as his fear that a movie like "Inherit the Wind", about evolution, couldn't be made today in the country's conservative climate.

"No applause please", he said. "I don't want to feel like I'm preaching to the converted."

It was almost unavoidable though. On this night, even a Springsteen hater might have been blinded by the light.
