It's been more than 20 years since Bruce Springsteen performed in Hampton Roads during the height of his fame following the release of 1984's 'Born in the USA.' Fans who flocked to the Constant Center on Friday night to see the 56-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer on one of the last dates of his solo acoustic tour were in for a much different show than the rollicking E Street Band performances of earlier years. One fact, however, was crystal clear: Bruce is still The Boss.

If that were ever in doubt, fans only needed to check out the rules Springsteen insisted on posting in and around the venue. No talking. No standing. No concessions during the show. No cell phones, etc. For the casual fan, these restrictions probably dampened the fun of seeing one of rock music's most legendary performers. There was no fist pumping, no jumping around on stage, no dancing arm in arm with the Big Man, saxophonist Clarence Clemons.

Without his E Street Band cohorts, the evening was quiet, and at times almost somber. The show opened with the sparsest possible version of 'Born in the USA', which Springsteen played only on harmonica. He sang through a vocal effect rendering his voice into something that resembled a scratchy old record album. This version of one of his biggest hits really underscored the often- misunderstood lyrics, which lament the poor treatment of Vietnam veterans.

Perhaps in honor of Veterans Day, Springsteen performed 'The Wall', which he said was written about a former musical influence from his hometown of Freehold, N.J., who died in Vietnam. Bruce spent time between songs talking to the audience in his whispery voice, still flecked with the blue-collar rhythms of his New Jersey upbringing. The low-key atmosphere was perfectly natural and even necessary for the mood of Springsteen's latest CD, 'Devils and Dust."

Released in May, it is an introspective album chronicling the underside of life. The CD's title track and 'Long Time Coming' were definite highlights of the Constant Center show. These songs featured Springsteen with nothing but a 12-string guitar and a harmonica. Although they were performed quietly, passion was clearly written on The Boss's face and in the intensity of his playing.

There were a number of gems throughout the evening. One of the night's lighter moments occurred when Springsteen got behind a grand piano and announced that Williamsburg native Bruce Hornsby was in the house. He then proceeded to pound out a boogie-woogie number.

'That's right, Hornsby', Springsteen said. 'This town just ain't big enough for two Bruces."

At that moment Hornsby walked out on stage reading a newspaper. Eventually, he replaced Springsteen at the piano, and the result was a high-energy reworking of 'You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch).' At its conclusion, Hornsby received a standing ovation from his hometown crowd.

Springsteen reworked many of the biggest hits of his 30-plus-year career to adapt them for an acoustic performance. Some of these interpretations worked better than others. 'Johnny 99' showed off Springsteen's considerable talent as a slide guitarist, and the vocal style worked hand in hand with the desperation inherent in the song's lyrics. However, his version of 'Darkness on the Edge of Town', with the chord structure changed significantly, made the song all but unrecognizable.

The Boss moved from piano, to guitar, to pump organ throughout the evening, and his striking musicianship was especially clear without a backing band.

However, when he picked up an autoharp to play 'The New Timer', from his Grammy award-winning 'Ghost of Tom Joad' album, it was a little over the top.

In a moment that might have been ridiculous but actually came across as very sweet, Springsteen grabbed another unorthodox instrument and began to play one of his earliest songs.

'I woke up at Old Dominion with a couple of co-eds and a ukulele', he said as he launched into 'Growin' Up' from his first album. As he attempted to play the song's guitar solo on the uke, he said, 'See' Size don't matter."

Toward the end of the evening Springsteen had lightened up considerably. He thanked the Norfolk audience for following the rules. A small crowd of fans was allowed to rush the stage, and during 'Blinded By the Light', a Springsteen-penned song that was a No. 1 hit for Manfred Mann, he even encouraged the crowd to sing along. After putting in plugs for the Food Bank of Southeastern Virginia and the Foodbank of the Virginia Peninsula, Springsteen shook hands with as many of the crowd gathered in front of the stage as he could. He seemed genuinely thrilled to still be performing great music for appreciative fans after so many years. His enthusiasm made him appear as youthful as he did 30 years ago when 'Born to Run' was released.

Even when Bruce Springsteen seems to take himself a little too seriously, as he did Friday night, his honest passion for the music and for performing makes attending one of his concerts an unforgettable event.
