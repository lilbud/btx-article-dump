He came out spoiling not for a fight but for renewal, securing "The Ties That Bind" with loud guitars, thundering drums and a few trusted friends he met in Jersey more than 25 years ago when he was a much younger, skinnier and brasher man. And he left on the last ride, bound for the "Land of Hope and Dreams" on the tracks of a gospel hymn so sweet that it didn't so much end the concert as send it floating out into the night, bound by our collective memories of this moment, this singular performer.

In between those twin peaks, which came three bountiful hours apart Monday at the United Center, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played with not just verve and passion, but with a joy that couldn't be feigned and a kinship that went beyond professional obligation. It was all a little corny at times, like the improbable script for a Neil Simon play about a coed, biracial rock 'n' roll band that rises from the East Coast boardwalks into the hearts and minds of millions: the Boss and the Big Man (Clarence Clemons), the Professor (Roy Bittan) and Miami Steve (Van Zandt), Mighty Max (Weinberg) and his silent bass-playing sidekick, Garry Tallent, accordion-playing Danny Federici, willowy Patti Scialfa, diminutive Nils Lofgren. Who are these people? Cartoon characters?

In a way they are, flesh-and- blood caricatures who remind us of a more innocent time, even as they confront what it means to be alive in the waning hours of the 20th Century. Springsteen's epic "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out" played like a tribute to his comrades, so devoid of cynicism and irony it couldn't possibly be a product of contemporary culture. And yet, it stakes its claim almost defiantly. On this tour, his first with the E Streeters in more than a decade, Springsteen is reclaiming something far deeper than a rock 'n' roll band. He's trying to remind himself of what matters under the guise of a reunion show that trots out most of the hits (and plenty of the obscurities too).

"I can't promise you life everlasting, but I can promise you life right now!"

It was Springsteen adopting the preacher's role the only way he knows how: redemption by way of the devil's music. All sinners welcome.

He played it for laughs, a big guffaw with a streak of darkness straight out of a Frank Capra movie, full of the knowledge that bad things happen to good people all the time, and there isn't much we can do about it.

Except: "I will wait for you/Should I fall behind/Wait for me."

The penultimate song for virtually every concert on this tour has been "If I Should Fall Behind", with Springsteen and his bandmates taking solo turns, one by one offering assurance, until the five vocalists are massed around a single microphone, a doo-wop group on a dimly lit street corner lifting a prayer wrapped in harmony.

The entire show seems designed to lead up to that moment-- a slow dance, understated and poignant. In the past, Springsteen's concerts inevitably concluded with exhausting rock 'n' roll medleys and were punctuated by fist- pumping anthems such as "Born in the USA"--a notable absentee on this tour.

Instead, the E Streeters are pushing the outer edges of their vocabulary: more reflective than ever on the twangy ballad "The Mansion on the Hill", a moodier and even more somber "The River", an acoustic "The Ghost of Tom Joad", and yet sounding almost unhinged on a fevered reinvention of the once-placid "Youngstown" and a bone-crushing "Murder Incorporated", before pulling out of the tailspin with a defiant "Badlands."

Springsteen has had better nights as a singer. Even though he pulled off some eerie falsetto cries, his once chesty baritone sometimes lacked character; he enunciated poorly and settled for a sub-Dylanish rasp on "Meeting Across the River."

But his authority as a performer and the depth and enthusiasm of his belief were awe-inspiring. His once scrawny frame is beefier, the hair thinner, and his kids are growing up. The songs reflected that reality, and the band played them with such zest that the only special effect required was the "On" switch for the house lights. Throughout the show, the concertgoers became not just Springsteen's audience, but his companions, his foils, an extension of his band.

It was, above all, a gesture of trust. It's why Springsteen still delivers the goods in concert; talented enough to lead, humble enough to know he can't do it alone. "Should I fall behind, wait for me."
