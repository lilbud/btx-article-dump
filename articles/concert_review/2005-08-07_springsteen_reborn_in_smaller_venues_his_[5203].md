This month, Bruce Springsteen is quietly wrapping up a solo tour of North America. In the wake of an acoustic album, "Devils and Dust", that has already drifted off the charts, he is playing to audiences one-fifth the size that would normally see one of his arena tours with the E Street Band.

But Springsteen is making some of the best music of his career this summer, and he hasn't been this engrossing and unpredictable on a concert stage since the '70s. There are none of the rituals, jokes and choreography that have dusted recent E Street tours with shtick and nostalgia. As he sweated buckets leading Clarence Clemons, Steve Van Zandt and the rest of his loyal clan in another chorus line on the last E Street tour, at least some longtime Springsteen watchers had to feel a little sad. Most of the fans loved it, and the band members stuffed away their retirement money, but Springsteen the artist had settled into routine. Here was one of the greatest rock performers living out one of his best-known lyrics: "Glory days, they'll pass you by ... in the wink of a young girl's eye."

Last weekend in a solo concert at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, where he gave a performance that eclipsed even his fine show three months earlier at the Rosemont Theatre, it was Springsteen doing the winking. The singer walked the line between loose-limbed self-confidence and iron-willed purpose; he was smiling and laughing like a man completely at ease with himself and his audience. He was clearly having a ball rummaging around in the back alleys of his extraordinary songbook.

**Better off**

It prompts a heretical conclusion: At this point in his career, the singer is better off without the E Street Band. He may not sell as many concert tickets or albums. But he's a more daring artist: darker, stranger, more at liberty to challenge himself and surprise his audience.

He opened with a rarely performed B-side from the early '80s, "Shut Out the Light." The arrangement was little more than a droning handful of chords on a pump organ, and it foreshadowed the adventure to follow. "Reason to Believe" arrived next, a swamp blues with Springsteen howling into his harmonica microphone while stomping the floorboards with a boot heel. He would build on these musical ideas for the remainder of the two-hour-plus concert, using trancelike patterns to evoke dreams, reveries, hallucinations.

Throughout, he tinkered with arrangements, tempo and melody, as if to slap the songs out of their comfort zones. On electric guitar, he used a modified "Theme from Peter Gunn" rhythm to evoke the feverish paranoia of "State Trooper." On acoustic guitar, he barely touched the strings as he knocked out a syncopated backdrop for a desolate "Promised Land." His electric keyboards drifted woozily as he shivered through the betrayals of "Point Blank."

What's startling to realize is that Springsteen is still growing as a musician and a singer. His piano playing has improved markedly in the last few months, as he built undulating patterns beneath the sparse chords of "Racing in the Street." The richness also resonated on the electric keyboards for the lovely "All That Heaven Will Allow", which he connected to the pocket symphonies of '70s power-pop group the Raspberries. And he surrounded "Darkness on the Edge of Town" with ringing, rapidly strummed overtones on an acoustic 12-string.

As a vocalist, he's using his voice not just to convey lyrics, but to shade them in new colors. His high, eerie, feminine cry sounded like a cross between Roy Orbison and a wind-whipped musical saw on the ghostly "Leah." Dropping to a whisper, or pulling away from the microphone and letting his voice fade, Springsteen used his voice to orchestrate mood as skillfully as he did with guitars and keyboards.

**Family and religion**

As resonant as individual moments were, they accumulated power in the way they played off one another. This was a show built around twin themes: family and religion, and, as Springsteen said, "The poetry, the mystery, the terror... " inherent in both. He said he was moved by the "images of transcendence and belief" in his Catholic upbringing yet constantly at war with what the church's unwavering authority represented in his life.

This conflict underscored many of the songs, from "My Father's House" to "Jesus Was an Only Son", in which Springsteen ruminated on what might have been had the world's most renowned martyr lived long enough to have a family.

It went unspoken, but Springsteen has been cast in the role of a rock 'n' roll savior a few times in his career. With the American flag as a backdrop and the E Street Band at his side, he has played the superhero who could rock any stadium to its knees. It was with him in this role that Springsteen's songs became miscast as arena anthems, the anxiety and turmoil coursing through them flattened by the need to entertain 20,000 fans a night.

But Springsteen the solo performer doesn't have to play to the back row of the arena. He can shrink the songs back to a more human dimension, and they can breathe again. Their finely tuned details change shape on any given night, depending on how Springsteen wants to perform them. His songs haven't sounded this adaptable, mutable and alive in decades.

It's why the singer's interpretation of "Dream Baby Dream", the eerie hymn by New York electro-punk duo Suicide, has closed many of the concerts on this tour. It allows Springsteen to end the show as he began it: singing over the undulating drone of the pump organ. The words are almost childlike: "Dream, baby, dream ...we gotta keep the light burnin' ... C'mon, baby, dry your eyes ...I just wanna see you smile." But as Springsteen sang them with gradually escalating fervor, they took on a hypnotic power.

With eyes closed, he was as riveting as drag queen Dean Stockwell serenading Dennis Hopper with a Roy Orbison song in the David Lynch movie "Blue Velvet."

It was a type of intimacy rarely seen from Springsteen before. The words were reassuring, but the music was not, and the effect was electrifying.
