Three hours, 41 minutes and 24 seconds of soul-searing, ground- shaking, fist- waving,mind-blowing rock 'n' roll, and it was over. Another Bruce Springsteen concert, another 55,000 fans reinfused with passion, another paragraph in the history of contemporary music.

Superlatives come easy when you're in- toxicated, and Springsteen's show sent a constant stream of clear, sweet lyrical wine through the capacity crowd at RFK Stadium here Monday night. The elixir kicked in with the first sip: a steamy, raspy, driving rendition of "Born in the USA", the song that's fast become his anthem for the nation, his broad-brush mural of America as a proud land of broken promises and shattered dreams.

And there was no letup. From the boisterous and defiant - "Born to Run"

"Johnny 99", "Working on the Highway" - to the poignant and hopeful - "My Home Town", "The Promised Land", "Dancing in the Dark" - Springsteen seemed bent on infusing every note with all the energy in his taut, muscular body (itself the product of a concerted weight- training program).

A working class hero is something to be.

A working class hero is something to be.

If you want to be a hero, well, just follow me.

\- John Lennon Every Springsteen performance is an exercise in controlled intensity, and every tune Springsteen writes is, in its way, political. On this, the first stop on his current American tour, however, there were some differences, if not in style, then of degree.

When the audience is on its feet virtually through an artist's entire concert, there's little doubt that he knows how to hold the crowd. And Springsteen has had his audiences standing for 10 years. Now, though, hesomehow seems better at it, able through the timing and sequence of his selections to orchestrate the response as well as to provoke it.

Likewise, there is no mistaking the message of a man who writes ballads about the unemployed and the hungry, about lives destroyed by foreign wars, about loneliness and terror and rage and despair in a country awash in an apathy born of affluence. But with the exception of a series of comments on domestic problems in response to President Reagan's invoking his name during last year's primary campaign, Springsteen has made a point of not entering the political fray rhetorically.

In this way, too, Monday night signaled a change, perhaps a personal or artistic growth, a recognition of the role of a pop hero and the influence he can have.

"Next time there's a war, whether it's in Central America or wherever it might be, you're going to be the ones they want to go", he told the screaming throng. "You need a lot more information than you get on the 6 o'clock news to decide what to do." Then, lest anyone mistake his point, he added that the country is on a clear course, "and where we're going is pretty scary."

It's difficult to tell how seriously the audience took his warning, but the only moments it seemed restless was during that short speech and another onhelping food banks. Appearances can be deceiving, but the underclass about which he sings so often and cares so much seemed little-represented at his concert.

Bruce Springsteen may have been born to run, but his polite, well- scrubbed teenage fans seem content to vent their social indignation vicariously.

It was encore time. Springsteen delivered with three sets, each as rousing as the one before, each filled with rock classics by the Beatles and Elvis Presley.

But first, he had a few words to say: "I'd like to know. I gotta know." Then he teased some more: "I want to know. I need to know." The crowd knew what was coming, but clearly wanted to prolong the moment. So their idol complied: "I just got to know. I just need to know."

A minute later, the gruff Jersey voice delivered the question and the name of the next song: "Do you love me?"

The stadium erupted. Lit matches filled the night. Even the concrete shook.

For almost four hours, they'd been waiting for him to ask.
