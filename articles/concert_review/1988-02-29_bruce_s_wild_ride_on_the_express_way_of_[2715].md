Worcester, Mass. - Armed with a mixed bag of songs and moods, Bruce Springsteen finds the light in his Tunnel of Love Express Tour, launched Thursday at the Centrum, performed to a third sell-out Monday.

If it's a joy ride you're after, he's the one. Despite an absence of staples like Thunder Road and Badlands, 16,900 spectators were as bewitched as they were bewildered by Springsteen's clear departure from pop demigod.

The show opens on a light note. E Streeters emerge to buy a ride from a carnival barker behind a ticket booth. Springsteen arrives last, in silver- tipped boots, black jeans and a satin vest over a white dress shirt. He tosses a bouquet of roses to the crowd and yells, "Ready for a date?"

And off to the circus he goes, breathing fire in one ring, clowning in the next and taking a few strolls on the high wire. The festive atmosphere belies a serious undertaking: to shed Born in the U.S.A's shackles of sainthood and hit machinery. On this three-hour merry-go-round, Springsteen succeeds in reinforcing integrity without yielding momentum.

He reaches deep into his catalog for rare B-sides like 1981's charming Be True and Roulette's thunderous nuclear protest, and plunges into Tunnel's dark corners eight times.

Humor and bone-rattling rock'n'roll take charge in the second set. Springsteen and Clarence Clemons reminisce about singlehood before storming into the rockabilly treat, You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch). The Boss mocks TV evangelism in a feverish sermon that precedes Coward.

He premieres a waggish Part Man, Part Monkey, does Elvis proud in Can't Help Falling in Love and crushes Joan Jett's rendition of his Light of Day. The concert closes with a fusillade of Rosalita and the Detroit Wheels medley.

The night fireworks are staggering, but it is a calculated lull that stole the show: a stirring, acoustic re-invention of Born to Run, the blistering anthem that once roared independence. Now it seethes a more contemplative urgency.

The band is typically unfaltering with a five-piece horn section pumping new life into classics. Patty Scialfa's higher profile and shimmering vocals give Tunnel's tales a luscious feminine charge.

Plainly delighted to be back on stage, Springsteen's euphoria matches the crowd's. "It's good to see you again!" he tells the glory-dazed. "Missed you!"

Likewise.
