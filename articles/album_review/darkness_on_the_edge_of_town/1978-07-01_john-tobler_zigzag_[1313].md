THE RETURN of the street people, which should be a good thing. First, Springsteen, whose scenario of misfortune has been so well publicised that there's no need for pointless repetition here.

I don't see any point in using any artist's business mistakes as some kind of excuse for what may be lacking in his comeback album, so I refuse to allow any sentiment (of which I had little anyway) to colour my judgment away from feeling that this album is pretty ordinary. It's a little difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes this so much of a depressing earful - perhaps the fact that since 'Born To Run' came out three years ago, a large resurgence has occurred of loud, dumb, fast and totally unintellectual rock'n'roll, which has stopped a lot of people taking themselves too seriously, and has conclusively proved that popular music goes totally in cycles - at this point, we're back in the late '50s, with an added ingredient of protest, which was to occur a few years later, although its original sentiments were expressed far more eloquently than the punks have managed.

Undigressing, the new Springsteen album would have been far more acceptable in 1976 than it is in '78. 1976 was a year when I was prepared to get into the untwisting of lyrics, prepared to tolerate and enjoy the odd dirge, but in June 1978, I'm not about to waste my time with sophisticated, even if well meant, claptrap. It pisses me off when a song like 'Racing In The Street' has a lyric that could conceivably have emerged from the pens of Chuck Berry or Brian Wilson, but is sung so slowly (but definitely not bluesily) that it makes your lids droop.

It has been said in another review that the album was re-recorded to the power of infinity because there was so much hanging on it, which seems a likely reason for the utter sterility of so much of it, and certainly the early take syndrome (as opposed to the clinical computerized perfection of recording over and over until it's absolutely right and immensely boring) has come back into its own with a vengeance recently, and produced a lot of much needed life. But more intriguing for me is the fact that each of the weekly music papers has assigned the record for review to one of their up and coming young lads, rather than letting anyone who was an original Springsteen rock writer assess it and compare it with the older stuff.

Do Mick Watts, CSM and the rest not feel terribly interested in Springsteen anymore? It would hardly be a big surprise to discover that when such as these early disciples heard the album, they too found it boring, or at least were unable to summon up quite the enthusiasm they felt should be accorded to their early '70s hero.

And finally, never forget that it was Springsteen himself who chose his business associates, and if they ripped him off, it was nobody's fault but his own. Feel sorry for him if you like (and I certainly feel sorry for him), but don't make his poor judgment an excuse for the fact that this record sounds like it belongs in another time and another place. Let's hope the next one's lacking the self pity and offers us a little hope - that's what you're entitled to expect from a Messiah. And I still prefer Greg Kihn's version of 'For You'....
