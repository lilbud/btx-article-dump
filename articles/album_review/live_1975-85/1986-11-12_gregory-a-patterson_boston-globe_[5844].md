What would you pay for The Boss' hot new album set>

How does $33.49 sound?

Or $24.99?

Or even better, $22.99?

Bruce Springsteen is tough, rugged, spirited -- as American as the competition that is now raging among Boston record stores in the wake of Monday's national release of his first authorized live album.

Carrying a "list" price of $33.98, "Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: Live 1975-85" is the hottest-selling item in Boston's record stores. And the competition is fierce as the stores compete for the hearts, minds and allowances of Boston's rock fans.

"We want to get them in the store and we want to sell them something", said Jeff Cohen, assistant buyer for Strawberries Records and Tapes. Strawberries" strategy is to sell the three- cassette, or five-record set for $22.99, with the hope that a good price inspires customers to patronize the chain in the future.

"With Christmas coming up, we're hoping that a lot of people come in here to do their album shopping", Cohen said.

But Bobby Hall, pop record buyer for the Harvard Cooperative Society, questioned whether The Coop should sell the album for its current $22.95 asking price. "It's one of those items that you could sell for much more"Hall said.

And Jere Rastellini can prove it. Rastellini, a salesman at Musicland in Somerville, said his shop has sold 20 of Springsteen's albums since Monday for $33.49 apiece.

The set's wholesale price -- the price that the stores pay for the album -- is about $19.

Dale Hamula, manager of Record Town in Boston, has put a $24.99 price tag on Springsteen's latest. "It's very reasonably priced for a five-album set. And from what I understand, that's how Bruce wanted to do it."
