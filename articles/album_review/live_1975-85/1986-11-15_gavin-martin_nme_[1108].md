GAVIN MARTIN rummages through his pre-Christmas stocking and uncovers the heavyweight Broooce, a five-album set of Springsteen live, including mucho unreleased material.

OPEN THE box - 34-page colour lyric booklet and a short note from Bruce. There is no commentary, the accompanying five albums recorded live across America over 10 years provides eloquent testimony to his status as the most resonant and charismatic performer in rock music.

A Springsteen live album has been on the cards for years, in the interim the demand has been met by a host of bootlegs. By the end of the Born In The USA tour last year the black market boasted a record of nearly every show on the tour. Voluminous as it is (40 songs, 200 minutes of music) Live/1975-85 can't hope, nor does it wish, to compete with the market supplying every last Bruce belch to the besotted.

Large chunks of sides 1-3 were live radio broadcasts, there's no scramble to include the many '50s and '60s cover versions or a stage favourite like 'Fever'. Rather the whole is carefully constructed to show Springsteen's growth as the irrefutable centre of, and most consistent voice in, popular culture. It's the ultimate titan's marketing ploy, allowing him both the last word on his myth and a breathing space. There could be no advance on the witheringly intense music that climaxes this LP. Live leaves the way clear for a rebirth as deliberate as Nebraska.

Does a decade of anyone merit this much vinyl? After three days' listening my answer must be yes. This is a thrilling document tracing Springsteen's growth from fantasist and dreamer to a stage where he combined it with responsive and perceptive maturity without being a contradiction. Much of that has to do with the equivocal relationship established between performer and audience, the longings, pains and hopes etched in his songs are widely felt. Springsteen and the E Street Band fuel tense anticipation more acutely as the set progresses, the exhilaration of shared release permeates this record like nothing you'll ever hear.

'Thunder Road' opens - the protagonist and his girlfriend looking for redemption in a broken-down car are dispossessed dreamers, everyday heroes. The song is beautiful and affecting, words dance on a piano rhapsody, the harp adds a lonesome edge, their concerns will remain constants throughout the record. But first Bruce has a headful of jukebox tunes and purple, image-laden street prose to unload. The joyous roar and classy swagger of the band is irresistible, adding all the bravado of romantic adventure to songs like 'Growing Up', 'It's Hard To Be A Saint' and 'Sandy'. But while hungry for escape and outlining an index of possibilities, Springsteen tries to cram too much in.

Wisdom and focus would come later as would restraint; here 'Adam Raised A Cain' is an overwrought firedance and the brooding drama of 'Fire' spoilt by a somewhat mannered vocal. In direct contrast to other megastars, as Springsteen has got bigger he's become less blustering and sprawling, more impacted.

Not that the panting blitzkreig of 'Rosalita' or a spirited version of Steve Cropper's 'Raise Your Hand' are without their charms, it's just that for all the group's barnstorming vigour in tackling a mediocre bunch of rockers from The River, on side four you know something has to change. The carefree recklessness is silenced by the closing 'Independence Day'. A calmly unfolded tale of struggle between father and son this is where the break is made, exuberant heroism now admits to fear and uncertainty. From here on Springsteen's personal odyssey and his vision of America is more troubled, more demanding - a quite different E Street Band sound is shaped to meet it.

Interestingly, side five showcases songs from Darkness On The Edge Of Town though that album preceded The River, but thematically it's more in keeping with the harsher world depicted in his '80s work. And the versions of the songs here, recorded at the dawn of the decade are a revelation; for anyone who ever lived with that record they are essential, uncovering new vistas and depth. 'Badlands' is a deep, searing wound, jarring, jagged - the gaudy youthful visions splinter; the furious claustrophobic power of the band is the only sustenance. 'Because The Night' and 'Candy's Room' sting and scream for love in a remorselessly pounding, vicious backdrop. There wasn't much allusion to sex in Springsteen's work before, but here the passion is inexorable and the voice resounds with a new surety. The clangorous, superbly embittered war of white hot guitar, saxes, synths and keyboards subsides for the haunting 'Racing In The Streets'. Here are the hearty fools from the old days on the New Jersey boardwalk but celebration is replaced by reflection, impending doom. Their quest now requires real heroism, the mounting splendour of the music is both a tribute to their endurance and a requiem for their dreams.

Springsteen the high dramatist, orchestrating his character's emotions by tapping into the elemental backdrop, scorches the landscape with the tunes from Nebraska. He precedes these with a version of Woody Guthrie's 'This Land Is Your Land' (along with the instrumental 'Paradise By The 'C", 'Because The Night', 'Fire', 'Seeds', 'Raise Your Hand', 'War', and 'Jersey Girl', that makes eight previously unavailable tracks in the collection). He talks about the song's history, how it was written as an angry answer to Irving Berlin's 'God Bless America', In so doing he's making claims on a tradition of disaffection that runs through American culture. What makes Springsteen unique among rock giants is that he's made the link between this culture and mass marketing.

At the moment the most atmospheric performances for me are thus the diligently assisted acoustic horror stories, 'Nebraska' and 'Johnny 99'. They hang suspended, echoing a terror which buries ever deep into the dark side of psyche; here the audience is confronted with experiences rather than asked to share them.

'Born In The USA' bursts with the barely contained rage memorable from its performance here last year, it's a lethal assault aimed at all the injustices and betrayals felt by native sons and America's enemies since the '60s. Anyone who thought it dodgy or jingoist evidently hasn't heard this blast of black fury. Along with 'Seeds' this is where the beleagured Springsteen characters get their payback. The latter is the nastiest slice of crude funk this side of There's A Riot Goin' On matched to a tale of uprooted dustbowl refugees. Here he does something that the drifter troubadours of the past never did - scouring and lambasting the source of injustice with an unsettling, ugly noise. A sentimental rambling monologue precedes 'The River' but it works, outlining penance, pathos, rebellion and reconciliation in keeping with the song's regenerative pulse, melody and message.

Sixties Motown classic 'War' finds a devastating new relevance, played as a matchless nuclear showdown. The disarmingly frank assertion before the song's launch that "in 1985 blind faith in your leaders or anything will get you killed" should silence those who doubt his intent. And the more you go on the better it gets, more inflamed, yet more intimate, a panoramic sound that doesn't become crowded, a group that knows the value of suggestion over bombardment.

Springsteen himself has learned economy and the knack of detail. 'Darlington County' and 'Working On The Highway' feature recognisable people, they could be and probably are your friends. His voice too has reached a peak of projection, he doesn't have to strain anymore, holding the audience spellbound with the locomotive slowburn of 'I'm On Fire', the vastly improved ballad version of 'No Surrender', and a gentle regreatful 'My Hometown'.

Throughout Live sticks to a rough chronology but rather than end with Born In The USA's most universal track ('My Hometown') side 10 is something of a reprise; familiar hopes and promises are reborn and affirmed in '10th Avenue Freeze Out' and 'No Surrender'. 'Born To Run' is a frantic swirling peal of Godlike thunder, performed at such a blasting pitch it's a miracle it doesn't crack.

Perhaps surprisingly it's not a Springsteen song but a Tom Waits (or T. Waite according to my label - I would've thought he was too busy saving hostages) that closes, a 1981 version of 'Jersey Girl'. Springsteen adds a verse of his own, giving the song added poignancy.

Live/1975-85 fulfills promises and supplies affirmations, it's all too easy to forget rock music is still capable of this. Almost without exception each composition is superior to the original recorded version - expressiveness more fully coloured, tenderness more warmly cushioned, rage more vociferous. It may not prove Springsteen is invincible (though he's closer than anyone ever has been) but it will make him immortal. £30? Cheap at twice the price.
