BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN doesn't trust myths. For a decade, his songs have been whittling away at the notion that the American birthright is unlimited opportunity and rising expectations. Now, with the new "Tunnel of Love" (Columbia 40999 LP, cassette and CD, scheduled for release tomorrow), he's confronting another illusion: the myth of love as perfect bliss and panacea.

On "Tunnel of Love", Mr. Springsteen turns from populist, arena-rock anthems to psychological reflections. It's a smart, good-hearted way to deal with the rising expectations directed at Mr. Springsteen himself - not a sequel to the 1984 blockbuster "Born in the U.S.A.", which sold 18 million copies worldwide, but a deliberate shift of direction and a scaling down. Where "Born in the U.S.A." shouted its messages, "Tunnel of Love" is conversational, even intimate - yet no less resonant. It makes Mr. Springsteen approachable again.

Through the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Springsteen came to embody one American myth: the self-made man, rock-and-roll division. Working his way from clubs to stadiums, avoiding flashy pop-star behavior, still showing up in clubs on the Jersey Shore, he's the working-class kid who hit the big time yet never forgot where he came from. "Born in the U.S.A." put him over the top: hit singles, the stadium circuit and the commercial momentum to release a five-LP live set that zoomed to No. 1.

Yet since the mid-1970's, he has been saying things the rock audience supposedly doesn't want to hear in its quest for escapist fun. His early songs swaggered with lusty self-confidence, ready to "burst like a supernova", as he sang on the 1972 album "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J." When his popularity did explode, though, it weighed on Mr. Springsteen and made him think twice about everything he wrote, trying to be a force for good..

From 1975's "Born to Run" and 1978's "Darkness at the Edge of Town" onward, his songs have insisted that most people are at the mercy of a brutal fate and an arbitrary economy - that dreams get crushed and upward mobility is a mirage. One by one, he examined adolescent exuberance, male buddying and honest work and found them wanting. His songs, as "Live/1975-85" shows, grew more deliberate; Mr. Springsteen's singing changed from an onrush of words to carefully placed phrases, in a voice edged with despair.

In a way, Mr. Springsteen's tidings could be comforting. They suggest that failure isn't a "sin" (a word he has probably used more often than any other rock songwriter) or a character flaw, rebutting America's unexamined social Darwinism. Yet as a songwriter steeped in popular music - he recently said that when he made "Born in the U.S.A.", he wanted to combine Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Phil Spector, - Mr. Springsteen did allow one utopian possibility: love.

In most pop songs, true love means happiness ever after. Come-on songs promise it'll last a lifetime; breakup songs look back to a state of Edenic bliss.

Love conquers all, fills every need, provides satisfaction and certainty, even in Mr. Springsteen's crumbling factory towns: "Hold me in your arms/ Let's let our love blind us", Mr. Springsteen sang in "Cover Me" in 1984. Of course it's never that simple (not on this planet), but the conventions of everything from classical comedies, which end with marriages, to dance records present love as an ecstatic refuge.

Mr. Springsteen, who married Julianne Phillips, a model, in 1985, wants pop to reconsider. Love, he's decided, doesn't drive away uncertainty - it raises new questions and new fears. Amid gleaming keyboards and screams recorded at a Jersey Shore roller coaster, the album's title song spells it out (with prepositions to spare): "You've got to learn to live with what you can't rise above if you want to ride on down, down in through this tunnel of love."

On his 1980 album, "The River", Mr. Springsteen wrote from a different angle about love growing cold. The music on "Tunnel of Love" echoes songs from that album, especially "Fade Away" (in the new "All That Heaven Will Allow") and "The River" ("Walk Like a Man" and "When You're Alone").

This time, though, Mr. Springsteen is doing most of the playing himself: dispensing early-1960's-style fuzz-tone guitar and a perfect organ line in "Two Faces", playing a bluesy guitar solo in "Spare Parts", creating a spacious country waltz (reminiscent of Rickie Lee Jones's "Last Chance Texaco") in "Valentine's Day." Members of his E Street Band appear as occasional sidemen; Clarence Clemons's saxophone, an E Street trademark, never shows up.

Back in 1980, Mr. Springsteen wrote about beginnings and endings of romances, not ongoing ones, and he was thinking about how hard times put pressure on couples. With "Tunnel of Love", economic woes recede. The album opens with "Ain't Got You", a stripped-down, Bo Diddley-style bit of hyperbole (with autobiographical overtones, perhaps: "Been paid a king's ransom for doin" what comes naturally") about a rich man who can't get the woman he wants.

Other songs use more typical, working-class Springsteen characters, but the pressures on them usually come from the heart, not the wallet.

"Tunnel of Love" has a loose story line: boy meets girl, marries girl, loses girl, misses girl. At a time when popular culture - not just songs but movies and television -relentlessly proselytizes for monogamy and marriage, "Tunnel of Love" seems to fit right in. But Mr. Springsteen doesn't treat standard situations in standard ways; in his new songs, monogamy means struggle as well as sanctuary.

Commitment takes guts. Meeting a girl on a Saturday night in "Tougher Than the Rest", he says that "if you're rough enough for love/ Honey I'm tougher than the rest", while a hymnlike synthesizer melody underlines his earnestness. "Brilliant Disguise", with its Drifters-style Latin undercurrents, and the bare-bones, Woody Guthrie-ish "Cautious Man" are about glimmerings of jealousy and infidelity in both partners. And in "Two Faces" and "One Step Up", the narrator battles his own worst instincts: "When I look at myself I don't see/ The man I wanted to be", Mr. Springsteen sings in "One Step Up."

Mr. Springsteen's characters don't cling to partners unconditionally; he's didactic but not dictatorial. "Spare Parts", an exuberant country-blues stomp, is about an abandoned, unwed mother who considers desperate measures, then decides to pawn her engagement ring and get on with life instead. And in "When You're Alone", a jilted lover rejects his ex-girlfriend when she eventually returns. "Lucky Man", the flipside of the "Brilliant Disguise" single (not included on the album), explicitly reverses most of the album's messages, saying, "I don't miss no girl I don't miss no home/ He travels fastest who travels alone" - although Mr. Springsteen's muttered vocals and the raw, galloping tune make him sound desperate rather than footloose.

"Tunnel of Love" isn't an intellectual breakthrough; Mr. Springsteen is hardly the first songwriter to address the limits of love. But with its dozen terse, careful, memorable songs, "Tunnel of Love" extends Mr. Springsteen's fatalism even further, dousing the last glimmer of unexamined hope and blocking the last escapist fantasies. "God have mercy on the man/ Who doubts what he's sure of", Mr. Springsteen sings in "Brilliant Disguise." Now, with "Tunnel of Love", he's no longer sure of anything. But he's facing his fears head-on.
