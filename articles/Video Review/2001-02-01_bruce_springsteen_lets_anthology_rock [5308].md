While rocking the rafters of concert halls for a quarter-century, Bruce Springsteen hasn't needed -- or avidly embraced -- music videos as a medium for his music.

Yet a new double-DVD set shows how he's navigated that realm with his dignity intact, rarely resorting to flashy gimmicks while largely letting the music speak for itself.

Bruce Springsteen: The Complete Video Anthology 1978-2000 collects 33 clips running almost three hours, about the length of a Springsteen show.

The first disc has all 18 videos from his initial Video Anthology 1978-1988, first issued on tape in early 1989 and still sold by some retailers. (So far the updated collection is not on tape.)

The second disc has music videos and performance clips from the past decade.

Also new to DVD for $24.98 is Blood Brothers, first released on tape in 1996 and still offered in that format. It chronicles 1995's brief reunion of Springsteen's E Street Band, both in the studio and performing at a Manhattan club.

A double-length concert album and concert video also are expected -- though not confirmed -- this spring. Both are rumored to be drawing from the 2000 tour's triumphant closing engagement at Madison Square Garden.

As for videos, Springsteen has kept it simple over the years, often working with film directors (John Sayles, Jonathan Demme) for quality control.

At first he resisted, making no videos for The River album and not appearing in the Atlantic City clip for the Nebraska album.

But with 1984's Born in the USA, Springsteen aimed to become a world- conquering rock hero, and one result was eight videos from that album and tour.

With no Born in the USA from which to draw, Disc Two isn't hit-heavy. But it's satisfying in its own way, with subdued, sensitive songs in an acoustic troubadour vein and one gem from last year's E Street reunion tour.

It's If I Should Fall Behind, from Springsteen's 1992 Lucky Town album, for which he ditched most E Streeters and hired new sidemen.

In the reunion's context, it becomes a stirring reaffirmation of the band's lengthy bond as rock 'n' roll brothers -- and one sister -- in arms.

Directed by Demme, it's shown in one uninterrupted take, like the Brilliant Disguise video.

The six-minute, letterboxed clip appears to be set in a studio, since no crowd noise intrudes. But it's done in the same way as it was onstage.

Against a black backdrop, Springsteen approaches a mike to sing the first lines, followed one by one by Steve Van Zandt, Nils Lofgren, wife Patti Scialfa and Clarence Clemons.

Not all are known for vocals, yet each sings with angelic soulfulness, underscoring the song's theme of staying true to loved ones through time's relentless passage.

Apart from subdued guitar and bass and Clemons' sax solo, it's done a cappella, capped by the five joining for a fervent finish.

Springsteen may be the greatest rock performer of our time, but this song -- so touching and tender -- is as good as anything he's ever done.

Disc Two also rocks, with rousing videos for Human Touch and Better Days and boisterous concert clips for Leap of Faith and Murder Incorporated. But mostly it's thoughtful if not melancholic.

Like Atlantic City,The Ghost of Tom Joad plays against a stark, black-and- white portrait of American desolation. Its Grapes of Wrath-style imagery is marred only by needless camera wobbling.

A second version of Tom Joad has Springsteen performing alone on acoustic guitar and harmonica during a 1995 Tonight Show visit. He's also seen on a 1998 Charlie Rose show, playing Born in the USA as a wailing lament.

Also in two versions, with an alternate string mix, is Secret Garden, Springsteen's loving celebration of women, seen in a montage of radiant, earthy diversity.

Another rarity is the gentle Lift Me Up, from the 1999 film Limbo. Not included as a video, it plays over the end credits.

Disc One's highlights include then-unknown Courteney Cox as the girl the Boss yanks from a concert crowd to dance with him on Dancing in the Dark; thunderous stage performances of Born to Run and Spare Parts; and Springsteen's credible acting as a grease monkey longing for a lovely customer in I'm on Fire.

There's also the badly lip-synched Born in the USA concert clip and performances of Thunder Road and The River -- using overly tight close-ups -- from the concert film No Nukes.

All videos are free of onscreen graphics. Menus are functional rather than busy, but it would help if songs were numbered.

Disc Two includes a complete discography. You can access the cover art and song lists for each Springsteen album while hearing a song fragment from each.

Springsteen, 51, doubtless will make more videos, rendering even this superb collection incomplete. But for now this double dose captures an inspiring artist's visual and musical evolution across more than two decades.
