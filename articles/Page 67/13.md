In January 2015, I put together a post of Springsteen songs covered by women, and it was one of NJArts.net's most popular posts of the year. I quickly did a "Part 2", made up of more videos suggested by readers, and that did very well, too. More than a year and a half later, the posts continue to get lots of hits.

So, here, finally, is Part 3, compiled mostly of comments from Part 2. Song songs were suggested by readers of Part 1 as well (after I had put Part 2 together), and some, I just happen to like, personally.

(UPDATE: There have been four more installments in this series, bringing the total number of songs to 150. Here is an index to all the songs.)

And below are the videos of Part 3, in alphabetical order (by artist). Get me some more good suggestions, in the comments section below, and I'll put together a Part 4 as well!
