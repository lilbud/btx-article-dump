Bob Dylan arrives in Britain next month hoping to repeat his triumphant series of concerts of three years ago. Many observers feel that his timing is unwise, for his performances will inevitably be compared with those of Bruce Springsteen, the American rock singer who finally opened his long-delayed London season at the Wembley Arena on Friday night. And no one, the feeling goes, can follow Springsteen.

There is an irony here. When Springsteen erupted into the drab rock scene of the early Seventies, delivering sparkling visions of teenage nightlife inspired by his apprenticeship in the run-down, shoreline bars and clubs of his native New Jersey, he was dubbed "the new Dylan". It took him years to live down the tag.

Nowadays, critics see in his music a synthesis of many of rock's greatest strengths: Presley's snarl, the romance of the Drifters, Phil Spector's grandiose mini-symphonies, the drive of the Rolling Stones and the social awareness of the punks. He is sometimes called the last great hero of rock and roll. His six-piece E Street Band, most of whom have been with him since the days on the Jersey shore, seem to be able to summon ghosts at will, but they also have their own distinctive and much-imitated sound.

Springsteen is himself noted for a fanatical interest in early rock. His current bedtime reading is a paperback called Elvis - The Final Years. It is his homework: a case-history, he says, of how not to be a rock star.

Four years ago, finding himself in Memphis, he tried to meet Presley. His method was typically straightforward, avoiding showbiz protocol: he jumped over Presley's garden fence. Within seconds, a prowling guard, who had never heard of Bruce Springsteen and who certainly did not believe that this disheveled kid could be a star, brusquely informed him that the King was in Las Vegas, and that he had better be on his way.

Most people who are not rock fans remain, like that guard, unaware of Springsteen's existence. He is to be found neither on family TV shows nor in the gossip columns (although he appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweekin a single memorable week back in 1975), and he has never had a hit single in Britain.

He is, however, indisputable the biggest concert attraction in the world: in Britain, more than 300,000 people applied for 105,000 tickets, bringing him to the attention of the up-market touts who normally trade in Buckingham Palace garden parties and Finals Day at Wimbledon.

His Wembley shows come in the middle of an 18-month world tour, with a total audience approaching 2,000,000. The next leg includes the inauguration of a new 20,000-seat stadium in New Jersey, where his song 'Born to Run' has been adopted as the state's official anthem; on the strength of a single radio announcement, which included snatches of his music but didn't bother to mention his name, half-a-million applications were received within a couple of days.

Harvey Goldsmith, Springsteen's British promoter, also handles Dylan and the Stones, so his assessment that the singer, "ranks up there at the top, which is amazing for a guy who's only been here once before" is perhaps muted by diplomacy. "You have to remember", Goldsmith continues in a tone of grateful astonishment, "that 99.9 per cent of these people have never seen him before."

That is not quite accurate. About 5,000 people saw Springsteen's two London concerts in 1975, when his morale was dented by what he saw as over-zealous promotion by his record company, which coined the arrogant slogan: "Finally London is ready for Bruce Springsteen!" The singer and his band tore down as many of the posters as they could find, but the campaign became a standing joke in the music business. Springsteen felt that he was losing control of his career, and thought about giving it all up.

"What my band and I are about is a sense of responsibility", he said last week, strolling along the Brighton sea-front several hours after concluding a typically exhausting concert. "If you accept it, that makes you responsible for everything that happens. People tend to blame circumstances, but in the end it's always your choice.

"Take Elvis. He lost control. After a while, he even lost control of his own body. Starting in 1975, I had to fight a battle to regain control of what I do."

The battle, which cut three years out of his professional life, was fought in a court-room, and ended with his manager being replaced by Jon Landau a former rock critic who had been giving Springsteen advice since wandering into one of his Boston performances.

Springsteen returned to the public eye with a strong feeling that even the playing of rock and roll entails hard work and obligations. He responded in his songwriting by abandoning the bright-eyed style of his early music in favour of sombre images of small lives eked out in the margins of American society.

He feels he should help his fans to avoid the trap which caught his father, and which he himself only just escaped. "My father was a pretty good pool- player, and not much else. When he was about the age I am now, he was offered a job with the telephone company, but he turned it down because it would have meant travelling away from his wife and kids. Years later, I realised how that missed opportunity had hurt him ever since. So I've always felt that if you're fortunate enough to be up there on stage, it's your responsibility to try and close the gap with the audience, to give them the sense that there are other possibilities, than the ones they may be seeing."

For Springsteen, taking that responsibility means establishing an unusually intimate relationship with the audience. Given a stage low enough, he will leap into the middle of the throng, singing and playing guitar solos while hoisted high on his fans' shoulders. Post Lennon, not many rock stars would take such a risk.

"It boils down", he said, "to a question of whether you trust people or not. I'm always inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. I get roughed up sometimes, when people try to pull chunks out of me, but mostly it's okay."

"It's vital to stay close to those people. I remember going to see bands when I was a kid, watching the musicians from real close up, studying the way they moved their hands, then going home and trying to copy them. Being in a band and playing music is what got me out of the trap of never realising my potential."

Born to working class Irish-Italian parents in an insignificant town, Springsteen came up the hard way and has always been renowned for his insistence on giving value for money. Earlier this year, in America, his concerts were lasting a marathon four-and-half hours, and his intense physical effort led to the minor breakdown which forced the postponement of the European tour. Now the concerts are trimmed to a shade under three hours, which is still unusually substantial.

He is small and hunched off-stage, a jockey with a lightweight boxer's muscles and he took the walk back to his hotel in the scuffed leather jacket, scruffy jeans and muddied boots he had worn on stage. His voice is hoarse, his speech slow and his thoughts introspective; in contrast to the eloquence of his song lyrics, he has a tendency to search doggedly for the right word or phrase, often without success.

What unfailingly cheers him - to his manager's occasional despair - is a chance encounter with his fans. Whatever the hour and however pressing the engagement ahead, he will chat, sign autographs and pose for Instamatics.

He feels he is only returning loyalty. Some fans cross continents to see him. Dan French, 23, worked for a London computer firm until he was made redundant last year. Now he produces a small photocopied fan magazine,Point Blank , titled after one of Springsteen's songs. He recently hitchhiked to concerts in Frankfurt, Munich and Paris, but he admits that even his devotion pales when compared with that of a trio of American girls who have followed the band around the entire European circuit for the past six weeks. "They're a bit of a legend on this tour", he says.

What the fans may not realise is that, however, much they may spend on travel and tickets, they are all being heavily subsidised. Few rock tours make money nowadays, their cost being reckoned a promotional expense. This one, with its 45-strong entourage of musicians, managers and technicians, its relaxed schedule and long-distance telephone calls, will show a loss of about $1million.

This is being underwritten, apparently without condition, by Bruce Springsteen's record company, CBS, whose corporate attitude is that of its managing director in Britain, David Betteridge. "Just by touring here", he says, "Bruce has doubled the sales of his current album. Once people have seen his concerts, they have to go out and buy his records. Fortunately, touring seems to be his lifeblood. Any other artist of his stature would have gone off to live on a ranch, Bruce just wants to work."
