Nils Lofgren isn't waiting around for Bruce Springsteen to call. Although he played guitar on the last glory day tours with Springsteen's E Street Band, Lofgren has resumed his solo career while Bruce fishes for a new direction and raises his infant son, Evan James, in Los Angeles.

Lofgren's new album "Silver Lining", which comes out today on Salem's Rykodisc label, has guest shots from Springsteen, Ringo Starr, Clarence Clemmons, Levon Helm and Billy Preston, but for the most part it is pure Lofgren -- zesty, melodic rock 'n' roll with plenty to say.

"Although there are some soulful touches from friends, we wanted to make this a Nils Lofgren record, not a 'Nils Lofgren & Friends' record", Lofgren said from his Los Angeles home yesterday. "And we wanted to make it as live and raw as we could. We avoided going back into the studio to fix up the rough edges.

That just makes it smoother and poppier. That's not what I wanted. We just tried to rely on our instincts this time."

Lofgren has toured with either Springsteen, Neil Young (playing on Young's "Tonight's the Night" and "Trans" tours), Ringo Starr (as part of Ringo's All- Stars last year) or with his own groups for the last 20 years. That spontaneous concert feel is indeed captured on the highly impressive "Silver Lining", which bristles with staunch guitar rock.

"I've noticed when I play live, even with the mistakes and the out-of-tune notes, there's an emotional honesty that isn't there when you go back in the studio to make things more technically correct, which I've done on some of my other records", said Lofgren.

The album's most laid-back song is the ballad "Valentine", which has Springsteen on backup vocals ("He was very gracious to come down and do that") and stars Springsteen and Starr in a new video to be released this Monday. The song was written as a tribute to Lofgren's wife, Cis Randall, an actress who now plays the role of a policewoman on the TV show "Hunter."

While Lofgren has moved beyond Springsteen for the moment, he still says it's possible the E Street Band may be revived in the future.

"Bruce never shut the door on the E Street Band. The press did that for him"said Lofgren. "No one knows in the future what will happen. But I guess the real story wasn't exciting enough for the press. The real story is that Bruce had been one of the only solo artists who had kept a band and not played with other people. So it was time for him to do that. He also has a beautiful new son, Evan, and he's digging him.

"The rest is open to debate. But I've heard some of Bruce's new album and it's great. I love Bruce. I'm behind him 1,000 percent."

Lofgren, who plans to hit Boston this spring with his own band (possibly with E Street drummer Max Weinberg), is quick to cite Springsteen and Young as influences on his present sound. "By working with Neil, I've seen him switch from lyrical to hard-edged, nasty playing, but always with melody. And Bruce is the same way. Even if he's belting out, it still has melody. And that's what I've tried to do."

Lofgren first met Young at the Cellar Door club in Washington back in the late '60s. Only 17 at the time, Lofgren fronted a band called Grin and was desperately seeking entry into the music business. "Neil gave me a guitar and said, 'Play me something.' I guess he liked what he heard, because when we got out to Los Angeles he turned me on to his producer, David Briggs. Neil then asked me to play piano on his 'After the Gold Rush' album. I knew how from playing accordion for 10 years."

Lofgren released three albums with Grin, then six solo albums -- the last being 1981. He was recently coaxed back into circulation by Rykodisc, the feisty independent that's scored with reissues of David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa -- and is starting to beef up its new-music offerings.

"My solo career has been a roller coaster", Lofgren admitted. "But Rykodisc said, 'Look, we want you to make an honest Nils Lofgren record', and I responded to that. All the other companies said, 'Give us a hit single or we're not interested.'"

Lofgren may still get a hit single with the Springsteen duet "Valentine", but the bulk of the album is confident, driving rock 'n' roll: Witness such tracks as the funky "Walkin' Nerve", the metallic "Sticks and Stones" (building like Dire Straits' "Telegraph Road") and the swampy "Gun and Run."

"I've finally realized I'm a blues guitarist at heart. I always wanted to sing like Muddy Waters or Howling Wolf, but my voice was never that heavy. So the nasty, raw things I feel are expressed through the guitar. And there's a lot of guitar on the record. If we were cooking at the end of a song, we decided to just leave it on there instead of taking it out. The public can fade it out if it wants, but that's up to them."
