Note: Originally only part of the interview was included in the thread. I found a transcript of the full 50min interview on Charlie Rose's website. Which is included below

**Charlie Rose:** He is a rock icon, a legend, and now a member of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. He is BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN. For the past 30 years, he's been writing extraordinary songs about ordinary people -- "The River," "Born to Run," "Born in the USA" and "Streets of Philadelphia," just to name a few, a very few. He has won eight Grammys and an Oscar for his achievements. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Tracks is his new four-CD set that features 56 previously unreleased songs and is garnering some of the best reviews of his career. In addition to song-writing, he's also known for his legendary intense concert performances that have lasted as long as four hours and more. Here is just an excerpt from one of those performances spanning a brilliant career. (excerpts from Springsteen performances) BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN for the hour. Welcome. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Singer/Songwriter: Thank you. It's great to have you here.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Thank you.

**Charlie Rose:** There's so much to talk about. Let me just begin, in looking at that concert, memories for you, when you see all that video footage of all those years where you've entertained so many people-- Was that the ultimate joy, to be performing in front of a live audience? Or was it sitting at home on a table like this, writing a song?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Writing's always the hardest work, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** That was, like, a lot of fun, though. So, the writing is the-- it's the blueprint of what you're going to do, you know? In other words, you sort of-- it's the essence of your idea that you're going to try to communicate to your audience. And the show is taking that thing and you expand -- performing it and performing it well sort of expands its boundaries and its power -- and you flesh it out and entertain people with it, you know? But I think it's-- I enjoy the writing a lot, you know? I mean, it's hard, and it's always hard to write a good song. You always need to have a new idea of some sort and-- but that sort of thing, that's the release that you feel after you've done the writing, and you come out, and you're finally face to face, and you're speaking to somebody. That's why you wrote that song, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** To connect.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. That's why, you know, I picked up a guitar and put the band together and wrote that song. So, that's the fulfillment of the whole process, you know, in some fashion.

**Charlie Rose:** You drove yourself through four hours, sometimes longer, to almost exhaustion.

**Bruce Springsteen:** T exhaustion.

**Charlie Rose:** TO exhaustion. That was how you would know. "I could not go one more song." Is that it?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Oh, I don't know. On certain nights, I suppose, you know? But it was-- it was an outgrowth of just playing in the bars, really. I think--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --that a four-hour show was-- when we did it, was something that there were only maybe a few other bands doing it--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --and it was something that didn't happen in a concert setting. But it happened every night in bars all across America, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. There were other guys doing four hours.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Right.

**Charlie Rose:** They just weren't playing before--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, and more, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** --a stadium full of people.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And more. And so, really, I think the length of the show came out of two things. Once I had a few records out, I wanted to play the songs that the fans wanted to hear, and I wanted to play all my new songs, too.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And then also, we'd gotten used to playing three hours-- a minimum of three hours in a bar, and you didn't feel like you'd done it, in some fashion. And I wanted it to be an extreme experience, also. I wanted it to be an experience that wasn't casual, that was somehow-- that pushed at the limits. It pushed at the limits. And so I wanted that extremeness, and I wanted people to see-- to be brought to some place and to come out of themselves and to be there, you know? So--

**Charlie Rose:** Would you test out songs at concerts? Or did it have to be perfect before you would perform it in front of lots of--

**Bruce Springsteen:** No, we played-- probably "Born to Run" we played quite a bit before I ever recorded it, in some slightly different versions. In the earlier days, you'd go out. And, if I had something I was excited about, I'd come out and play it, you know? And so I think that there was initially a lot of audience-- I don't know if it was a test, but it was just something you were excited about doing. If you had a great riff, you wanted to hear it-- you wanted to hear it that night, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And if I had the-- if I had most of the words that went with it, sometimes I'd give it a shot, you know? That changed a little bit, as we went on-- yeah, if I had a new song I liked, I'd come out and play it. And I played "The River" before it was recorded, and it was-- you know, you just felt it had an urgency that you wanted to-- you know, "Tonight's the night I got to-- I got to sing that tonight."

**Charlie Rose:** Fifty-six of these songs we've never heard before in this four--

**Bruce Springsteen:** That's what they say.

**Charlie Rose:** Well, I-- 10 of them we've heard before, some in different versions, like "Born in the USA."

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** There's a version here--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** --that's rawer.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Right. It's a different-- it was the original version that I cut in my bedroom, you know? We-- on the-- 56 has not been released before.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And I think 10 of them are-- some of them are B sides, and some others-- and a few other things that I've wanted to include. But, yeah, the original version of "Born in the USA" that should have probably went on Nebraska, maybe-- I don't know, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. But you didn't put it in at that time.

**Bruce Springsteen:** I didn't think it was finished, and it was-- It was one of my first songs about Vietnam, and I was trying to-- I think I wanted to make sure I had it right, and I wasn't quite sure that I'd finished it. Listening back, it was-- it came out pretty good, really. And I think now I might have-- if I was making that decision today, I probably would have put it on, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Put it in Nebraska.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I would have put it in Nebraska. But you know, that-- at the moment, I was careful with it. And I think what-- see, I was recording Nebraska and Born in the USA simultaneously, the rock record. And so I had sort of these two very different things going on, and one of the first things we did was cut the band version of "Born in the USA." And when I heard that, I felt that that was really powerful, and I knew that that was going to be the centerpiece of the music I was doing at that time, and so I went with the band version.

**Charlie Rose:** How was it for you to go back and through to the very beginning and listen-- I mean, you have John Hammond, the great, legendary CBS Radio executive at the beginning of this, who, in a sense, saw you--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** --and heard you and said--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Right. Right. That was a big thrill.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. But how was it for you to go back and listen and hear songs that you had, for whatever reason, said, "Not ready"? "Not now"? "Not this album"?

**Bruce Springsteen:** It was fun. It was enjoyable to do now because what it is, is at the time you're making those decisions, you're-- you've put a lot of pressure on yourself. Sometimes I'd have a particular theme or context going for a particular record, and you're caught in a very specific moment in time, and many of your decisions are coming out of that state of mind. I think you get to go back 10, 20 years later, and you're free of that-- of that context, and you can just hear the music as it was played and as it was, you know? You're not concerned about whether this fits in this particular record, or what kind of song it is. The music is just what it is. And so it was nice to go back and enjoy the stuff just for what it was. And when I was able to do that and get outside of my own head about it, I realized that, "Oh, that could have went on," and "This could have went on," and "Boy, I should have put that song on." And I tried to pick the things that were-- that I felt were as good as the stuff we released. I went very carefully through the hundreds of songs that we had, and things that felt like they could have come right off of those records in some fashion or another, the quality, that kind of quality.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Where are you musically now, do you think? I mean, I've heard that there is a country-and-western collection of songs--

**Bruce Springsteen:** This has been-- I've been asked about this. I make a lot of different kinds of music, you know, and all the time, I think, basically, you know, I've made country music and--

**Charlie Rose:** Why didn't you release that?

**Bruce Springsteen:** --I have a lot of different types of projects. Oh, they're not finished or--

**Charlie Rose:** Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --it's something you're passing through for a moment and-- or it's just something you're-- you know, that particular thing came through the Tom Joad record--

**Charlie Rose:** Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --where the Tom Joad material was so intense that in between-- in between cutting the story songs, I'd have a Western-swing thing, and I had a small, little country combo with Gary Tallant (sp) and Dan Federici and a great steel player, Marty Rifkin from Los Angeles. And so we just move into things that felt conducive to that instrumentation, but it never formed into a record. And for this record, I was very-- I specifically chose things that came from records that I'd released--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --that there'd be a context for my fans to go back, and if you like "The River," there's an album from "The River." If you like "Born in the USA," there's almost an entire album from "Born in the USA." So, I wanted the things in this collection to refer back to the records that I'd released and fill those records out and give people a broader idea of what I was doing in the studio and the kind of music we were making at the time.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. So this, in a sense, is an insight into where you head was, I mean, moreso than just what you saw. Some say it's a kind of an alternative vision.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I'd say that it's a bit of an alternative career, in some fashion.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** There was a-- you know, like, it was the music that--

**Charlie Rose:** It's like this career you took, and this is the career that have taken from--

**Bruce Springsteen:** This is the road-- yeah--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah, the road not taken and the road taken.

**Bruce Springsteen:** I mean, they-- on certain records, they intersect more, and on certain ones, they wouldn't. You know, there's party songs from Darkness on the Edge of Town, and so there's-- but a lot of things that were from The River, the second CD, which is The River collection, could have come out on that record. And I tended to leave off things that-- sometimes I veered away from things I felt-- I hate to say the word "too entertaining," but I was-- I always-- I tried to have a very hard focus on my records. You know, it was a part of a way that I protected myself at the time. I think I protected my identity and who I wanted to be and what I wanted to say. And so I made a lot of tough decisions and left off a lot of music that was actually very enjoyable that I'm glad I can get out now.

**Charlie Rose:** Why isn't "The Promise" in this set?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I've been-- basically, I went back and I listened to it, and we never really got a good recording of it, in my opinion, you know? It's been a favorite song of a lot of-- a lot of people mention that one to me, and it sort of was the sequel to "Thunder Road," in some fashion. It referred back to those characters. But I went back and-- and we sort of had a very plodding, heavy-handed version of it, and I couldn't quite live with it, so maybe another time.

**Charlie Rose:** You know how much your fans are asking about this.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. They-- I've had a few-- "What happened to 'The Fever'?" and, you know, that stuff.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Well, that's the other-- that's my second question. What happened to "The Fever"?

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know, it's stuff that just has been-- that was something that-- I had it sequenced at one time, and it was very long. And Southside did a great version of it, and it's never been one of my favorites. So, it was sort of-- I said, "Well, I'll put this on a B side or something, but"-- and it's kind of-- it just-- it was a sort of a sequencing decision. It kind of slowed the way that the music felt to me down when it came up, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** But does that mean we'll never see it?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, it's been seen. It's probably seen in more homes than-- but it'll--

**Charlie Rose:** No, I--

**Bruce Springsteen:** We have a nice version of it--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --and it's mixed, and I'll probably get it out. I thought of putting it out on a B side, if we put a single out or something, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Where do you rank "The Wish"?

**Bruce Springsteen:** That was a funny song because it was-- after-- it was a song about my mom--

**Charlie Rose:** Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --which was-- I wrote a lot about my dad, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And--

**Charlie Rose:** This was the only song you wrote about your mom?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. It was really-- yes, it was, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** This is the person--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Directly.

**Charlie Rose:** This is the person most responsible-- most responsible--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** --for your career.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** A $60--

**Bruce Springsteen:** I'm ashamed of--

**Charlie Rose:** --electric guitar.

**Bruce Springsteen:** I'm ashamed of myself.

**Charlie Rose:** Way back when.

**Bruce Springsteen:** So, what does that mean, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Exactly. (crosstalk) Why you wrote all these songs about your father-- does that mean it only comes out of sort of pain and not out of joy and not out of-- what?

**Bruce Springsteen:** No, it's so complicated. I mean, I could get on the couch here and we could-- we could go on about it. But I've said a few other places that I think a son's relationship with his father, particularly, but with both your parents-- it's your most closely observed relationship. It's the relationship you watch every single day, you know, about how to tie your shoes, you know, how to walk, you know, how to-- how to address people, how to treat people. I mean, you're learning all those things, and you're internalizing them. And I think that that's-- as parents, you know, you can forget how closely you're being watched. You're being watched so closely, you know? And that stuff goes in, and it lays deep, you know, and it's there forever. And I think that, along with a lot of-- it was-- I think you tend to write about things that you're trying to sort out. You know, I think you're trying to write about things that you don't understand and you want to understand, and so you're working on something to help you understand what that was all about. You know, who were you? And who was he? That's why-- that's a big part of what writing-- writing does. I think, you know, a lot of-- a lot of-- that's where-- it comes out of that particular fire, you know? So, I think that those are the things that-- that you carry and that you are always trying to put in context and make sense of. And I did a lot of it through my work and things, you know? But-- and my mother was very consistent and was somebody who-- we had a relationship that was-- I don't know. It was easier to understand, you know? It was nurturing, and there was faith involved and support and a lot of giving love, you know? You know, that was something that I shied away from writing about. I think writing about your mother in rock-- it's easy to write about your dad in rock-and-roll.

**Charlie Rose:** Because it's what, it's angry, it's more--

**Bruce Springsteen:** It's angry, it's--

**Charlie Rose:** --born out of rage--

**Bruce Springsteen:** It's rebellion. You know, it's about--

**Charlie Rose:** Rebellion.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --rebellion.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** It fits more in what-- in the kinds of emotions that rock came-- rock-and-roll came up out of. And so, you see, songs about your mother-- there's gospel music. There was a gospel group called The Mother Lovers, I think--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --at one time. I think that, you know, country musicians, you know, Merle Haggard, you know, "Mama Tried," you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And you see a lot more of it in rap music. You know, there was a-- you know, so it's-- it's-- but it's-- it was a fun-- it was probably one of the most autobiographical songs I ever wrote, really. It was just very detailed and very specific, you know, incident by incident. And it was sort of a very-- that moment that's sort of like a-- you don't know when-- it was a very divining moment, standing in front of the music store, you know, with someone who's going to do everything she can to give you what you needed that night, that day, you know, without-- and having the faith that you were going to make sense of it or not, you know, that it was just what you needed and desired at that moment. It was a great sacrifice on her part. It was $60, but that was, you know, finance company money, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And so it was-- so I finally got a song out about it. I gave it to her many years ago, but it's the first time it's been out on record.

**Charlie Rose:** What did she say when she heard it?

**Bruce Springsteen:** She liked it.

**Charlie Rose:** I bet she did.

**Bruce Springsteen:** "About time!" you know, or something, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Let me just stay with the family for a second because you said once that "The two most hated things in my household were me and the guitar." Your mother gave you the guitar, and you-- at the end, your dad and you came back together? Got together--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Oh, yeah.Sure.

**Charlie Rose:** --and he helped you understand what it meant to be a father for a son, yes?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, you--

**Charlie Rose:** Or at least what?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, you learn-- you learn by-- you know, you don't learn by just the good things that are taught.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** You learn by your bad experiences. And that's just the way that it goes, you know? We internalize everything and carry it with us. And our job-- the way we create our lives is by sorting those things out and sorting them through. That's how we honor our parents and honor the people who've taught us, you know, is in divining our own path and our own road through the things that they handed down, both the good things and the bad, you know? That's essential. You know, that's how you find yourself and get to your place in the world. So, you learn by only-- you know, you learn-- it's all a lesson, you know? I think with my children, I try to be patient and not run and be there and-- but I think also to respect their wishes, in some sense, the serious wishes, you know, the serious desires, if they have an interest, you know, to indulge it, you know, that's how you know, you don't know. You know, you don't know what that moment might bring, you know, 10, 15 years down the road. I read a short story once that was talking about a boy who went with his uncle fishing every Saturday. And he says, "To my uncle, it was just a fishing trip," you know? "But to me, it was a permanent work of art that was constructed in my head, and I'll carry that with me throughout your"-- you know, "throughout my life," you know? And why do we think of things 30 years later, some small incident that we'll be thinking of when we're dying, on our deathbed, you know, some small incident that had no apparent meaning on the day that it occurred, you know? Those are the things that-- that's the essence of what it's all about. And so you have to-- think when you address your children, you have to always be on the lookout for that-- for that moment, you know, in some sense. But it's not really-- it should be just sort of a daily way of interacting, you know? So I've tried to-- I've tried to do that better.

**Charlie Rose:** Do you know why you have such genius, skill?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Hey, I'm going to hire you.

**Charlie Rose:** No, no, no, no. At songwriting. I mean, you-- not me, the Hall of Fame will say something like this, you know, what you've just been--

**Bruce Springsteen:** See, I didn't think I did.

**Charlie Rose:** --elected to-- I mean, the capacity to write a song that digs deep and understands and resonates-- I mean, you didn't go to school to get that. You didn't have anybody even teach you that. You just sat down and did it.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well--

**Charlie Rose:** Right?

**Bruce Springsteen:** There were a lot of teachers. I think there's a lot of-- you know, first of all, I didn't think I had a great talent at it. You know, I thought that I was somebody that was going to have to really work harder than the next guy, you know, to formulate my own ideas and my own visions. And I did. When I was a kid, I did work harder than everybody else. You know, I was eight hours in my room every night, and six hours-- and when the dance was on, I was the guy standing like-- you know, with his arms folded in front of the guitar player, you know, all night long, you know? So, I felt that it was-- it was something that I was going to have to work at very hard to do well. And then the rest-- there's a certain amount of-- I think of psychology that comes with what kind of person are you. Are you a watcher? You know, are you somebody who-- do you jump in, and are you active right away, or do you-- or do you watch? Do you stand back and observe? That was always my nature. My nature was I was standing back, and I watched the way things interrelated and the way-- what was going on around me. I might have been too frightened to join in. I didn't know how to join in. So, it was a part of-- observation was a part of my psychology. And I think that has a lot to do with people who then go on and write or take their own thoughts and formulate them in some fashion. It's usually a result of a variety of dysfunctions that you've managed to channel into something positive and creative, rather than destructive. And so it came out of that need, you know, sorting yourself out once again, you know? So, that's sort of-- I think it was easier for me to observe, and it's something that, when you're writing, and particularly all different kinds of detail, that comes in handy. So, it was-- part of it was, I think, natural, and part of it I worked really hard at.

**Charlie Rose:** Well, this album, as I said, begins with John Hammond. You come to CBS, and you've got some-- they asked you to play what, four songs?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. No, that was-- it was in an afternoon, and I came up from New Jersey on the bus, and it was-- I didn't know how many songs. So, it could be one song and out. I wasn't sure, you know? I was--

**Charlie Rose:** You didn't know what to expect.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, I had a lot of confidence. I was pretty cocky, you know, and-- because I'd had a lot of success, you know? I mean, not big success, but I was-- you know, I had a band, and we played to 2,000 or 3,000 people locally. You know, we drew a lot of people--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --at one time, with no record or anything else, so--

**Charlie Rose:** Just word of mouth, almost.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, so I knew what it was like to play in front of thousands of people already, and--

**Charlie Rose:** And you knew you were doing something that was right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, somebody was saying-- you know, I heard, "Hey, you're good."

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah, "You can do this."

**Bruce Springsteen:** And I didn't know-- I heard the guys on the radio, and I said, "Well, gee, I'm as good as some of these guys." And so I went in with a certain-- I went in with a certain confidence, but at the same time, at the bottom, you don't know. You know, this is-- this is one of the greatest music figures--

**Charlie Rose:** This is the man who discovered Bob Dylan.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. And so you're walking in, and you know, I didn't know what the response might be, you know? But it was-- I played a couple of songs and--

**Charlie Rose:** What'd he say to you?

**Bruce Springsteen:** H said, "You got to be on Columbia Records." That was the first thing he said.

**Charlie Rose:** No dummy there, Mr. Hammond!

**Bruce Springsteen:** That eased the tension. That eased the tension a lot for me, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** You said--

**Bruce Springsteen:** And--

**Charlie Rose:** You said, "We can get along, Mr. Hammond. There's a basis here for a"--

**Bruce Springsteen:** But I always-- big smile, you know, because I was-- I was-- I was looking down, and I was playing, and I was trying not to look up. I didn't want to-- you know? And so finally, I did a song-- I think I played "Saint in the City," and I looked up, and he said, "You got to be on Columbia Records." And that's what he was-- like, he was-- he was just unbridled enthusiasm, you know, about all kinds of music.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know, I'd go to his house, and he'd play me jazz, and he'd play me all different types of--

**Charlie Rose:** A teacher for you.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, and he was just endlessly enthusiastic about-- about anything he thought was exciting, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** But at the beginning, didn't they try to make you into a kind of new Dylan, or nearly, a sense of--

**Bruce Springsteen:** I probably did-- helped out with that a little bit?

**Charlie Rose:** In what way?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Oh, hey, Bob's a-- Dylan's a big, big influence, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And at that point in my life, I still a great hero of mine, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** You play--

**Bruce Springsteen:** And--and so I-- but I think that-- I know what you're saying. I think that at the time, when you went in, you know, there was-- there was those obvious connections in the music.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** I was writing a lot of lyrics, and my voice was kind of husky, and I physically, you know--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --had a lean look. And so-- and it happens with every artist. This is-- you got to be-- you know, there's very rarely, "And we'd like to present you with something you just have never heard of, you've never seen before." You know, they were trying to make, I suppose, some connection. It was funny at the time. I remember my first photo shoot was in New York City, and there was-- and there was-- it was my first introduction to, like, somebody was going to try and manage my life now--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --in some fashion. And, if I wasn't carefully, manage also my identity, and that was something that I was very frightened of. That's why I was walking down the boardwalk one day, and I pulled a postcard out of the rack outside a little gift shop in Asbury Park, and I brought it up to the record company, and I said, "Yeah, I want this to be the album cover, because I'm from New Jersey, you know?"

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And it was a way of saying that--

**Charlie Rose:** This was Greetings From Asbury Park?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. That was the postcard.

**Charlie Rose:** And you said, "This is the cover."

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, yeah. I said-- I said, "I'd like this to be the cover."

**Charlie Rose:** "I'd like this to be the cover." And they said?

**Bruce Springsteen:** And they said, "OK," you know?

**Charlie Rose:** And that was it.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. They said, "All right." And they said, "This is great."

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And so it was-- it was terrific. I think that what it is, is-- what I found with record companies in general, if you know what you want to do, you know, and you're sure about what you want to do--

**Charlie Rose:** Yes.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --and who you are, you know, very often -- not always -- you know, there's somebody, "Oh, that sounds like a great idea." They'll listen, you know? And so I remember I was shocked at how easy it was. I said, "Wow. This is going to be my album cover."

**Charlie Rose:** Yes.

**Bruce Springsteen:** But it was important because I realized-- well, I'm from New Jersey, first of all, and I felt that that had a lot to do with the music I was writing. And also, it was going to make me-- it was going to allow me to be myself. You know, it was going to differentiate me from some of the other artists that were out there at the time. And that's always a struggle in your early years, is how to sustain or maintain and hold onto your identity and what you want to be about because it can go a lot of different ways, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** How much do you-- what do you owe Dylan? I mean, what's the connection between you and Dylan? How do you see it, other than the fact that you were songwriters, the fact that you seemed to do it more poetically than your contemporaries, and that there was substance in what you wrote about, and you both had that lean and hungry and dark?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Well, when I was 15, and I-- you know, I was-- I had Highway 61 on my little mono record player in my room at night--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --you know, and listened to it, you know, a thousand times. And you know, it's one of those debts that you can never repay, you know? That's all. It's just--

**Charlie Rose:** But you feel the connection.

**Bruce Springsteen:** It's just-- it's-- yeah, I just have a deep involvement with his music, you know, like any other fan, you know? That's-- I always have and--

**Charlie Rose:** More Dylan than anybody?

**Bruce Springsteen:** --I'm always-- well, I liked a lot of different kinds of music, you know? I think he was really important, in the sense of bringing into, you know, pop-songwriting all kinds of different topics and subjects and serious subjects that hadn't been really a part of the pop world previously very often, you know? And I was interested in going there, and that's him. When you look at anybody who's doing that, I think, whether it was Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?" or--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --I think even Public Enemy, some of the-- you got to-- you trace it back in some fashion to that moment when-- "Hey, I can-- you can sing about this and get on the radio. You can sing about it and get on the radio, and people are going to connect to it and try to make sense of it." You know? So, that was a big, big influence. But I think-- the first one, I mean, obviously, was Elvis and--

**Charlie Rose:** What was Elvis?

**Bruce Springsteen:** That was, you know, my mother-- my mother sort of had him on TV when I was 9 years old, and I was shocked. I stood there-- I was playing with my-- I didn't-- and I just-- there was some shock of recognition even at that young age, like-- maybe it was just "That looks like fun."

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know?

**Charlie Rose:** "That's for me."

**Bruce Springsteen:** And-- is a-- And--

**Charlie Rose:** Go ahead.

**Bruce Springsteen:** No, it was just, you know, "How do you do that?" And then-- and so-- but there was-- but I think, also, I drew a lot from anything I heard. You know I liked all the one-hit wonders, Swinging Medallions, one-hit wonder rock bands, bands that, you know, you heard once and never saw again, Music Machine, who, you know, just came up with some record that was just essential and part of what I did, I wanted to have a lot of that into it, too, just nonsense and fun and clowning around on stage and-- you know, I wanted all those elements in my music in some fashion, and so I was really sort of influenced by, basically, everything I had heard up-- you know, all the way through, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** You told Ed Bradley that story about going to see Elvis down there, and you tried to get, and you climbed.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** You climbed up on the wall--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I tell that to the--

**Charlie Rose:** --at Graceland and said, "Hey, I want to see"--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** --"Elvis." And they said, "Who are you?" And you said, "I'm on the cover of Time and Newsweek. I'm BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN." And they said, "Out of here."

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, that--

**Charlie Rose:** Is that about it?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I don't think he believed me. I was telling-- I was telling Bob yesterday-- Costas and I said, "That was the only time I ever really pulled that one out." I was always kind of embarrassed. But I said, "But that night, when I had to pull out everything I had"--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Exactly

**Bruce Springsteen:** --I said, "Man"--

**Charlie Rose:** "Believe me."

**Bruce Springsteen:** --"anything I had that I felt was going to get me to-- get me up that front stoop, I was just-- I was pulling out," you know, so--

**Charlie Rose:** Why did you want to see Elvis?

**Bruce Springsteen:** That's a good question. You know, I was just-- I was a big fan, and--

**Charlie Rose:** Have the songs gotten more political over time, do you think?

**Bruce Springsteen:** M music?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** I don't know. I think that my music, because of what I wrote about, always had political implications and I suppose that came up out of-- originally out of my home life, you know, and my experience growing up and my relationship with my father and understanding and trying to understand the concept of work and how work plays a central role in your life, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** I had two real, very different examples, you know? My mother's relation to work was very joyous, was very happy, you know, and provided the entire family with stability. And it-- what she gained from it was an entire mode of behavior. You get up in the morning at a certain time. You prepare yourself. You get yourself ready to go to a job. And you walk down the street, you know, and you're there at a particular time in the day, you know, and you interact with your co-workers, and that's a big part of your social life and your work life and your place in the world. You know, you're doing something that has a purpose. You know, there's a reason you're there besides just feeding your family, you know? You're a part of the social fabric, you know? You're what's holding the world together. You're what's holding your town together. That's what's holding your family together. And I always remember she walked with tremendous pride and strength, enormous strength. And it gave-- it gave such great comfort, such great, great comfort, you know, to a child. You know, it was, like, "That makes sense. I understand that," you know? And I think my dad had different experiences. Work was involved with pain, you know? He lost his hearing when he worked in the plastics factory. He lost a lot of his hearing. He struggled to find work and to go to work, you know? It led to-- the regulation of behavior that work provides wasn't a big part of his life, you know? And that was painful, you know, for everybody involved. That's essential. That's central. That's central to the way that we live and think about ourselves and who we are and the place we live and so I saw both sides of it. I saw what happens when that's not present. There is pain, and there is anger and deep, deep-- just-- It's a very-- it's a destructive force. You wither away. You waste away. You don't know where you're going or who you are, and you take that out on the people that you care about, which is something that you don't want to do, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** But it happens. So, that's what I wrote about. That was what I wrote about, and that was really, really important. It's the single thing I've written about my entire life, that fundamental idea, the importance of that idea in society, the cost of not providing that, for whether it's that people will be able to take care of their families, to have productive jobs, the debasement of ourselves, you know, in not having a society where that's provided to all our citizens, you know? That was-- it all grew from there. It grew from my experience and my trying to sort out my experience. I didn't grow up in a political household. I didn't have some particular ideology or be a particularly political person from where I came from, you know? But I needed and wanted to write about those things because I felt they were essential, so a lot of my music has grown out of that place over the years, you know, and continues to to this day.

**Charlie Rose:** And that is, in part, I assume, connected to the reason that you were affronted when the Reagan campaign, you know, used "Born in the USA."

**Bruce Springsteen:** And I thought he-- He was hurting working people.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. Exactly.

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know? And you know, it actually wasn't "Born in the USA." He just included me in a speech--

**Charlie Rose:** Right. Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --at a particular time.

**Charlie Rose:** He mentioned you, right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And you know, the Republicans at that time, they co-opted anything that was American, and--

**Charlie Rose:** The flag, whatever--

**Bruce Springsteen:** --my music has been American music, you know? But, you know, I thought that the policies were destructive. I thought he contributed to the disparity in wealth that continues to this day, you know? And, you know, it made me angry, and it made me think a lot harder about what I was doing and a way to communicate what I was-- what I was communicating.

**Charlie Rose:** Do you feel-- have the same connection to those ideas when your life is so different today than it was then? When you have, in a sense-- you now have great joy-- a wife--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Oh, yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** --children, you know, financial resources. Is the deep depth of that connection to those ideas any different?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I think that--

**Charlie Rose:** Those feelings, those emotions, those things that give--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I understand what you're saying. I think, basically, you write from the entirety of your experience, you know, first of all, I think. And you know, those are things that I've been driven to write about, and I find that I still am, you know? I've been fortunate, and I've been able to make a real life for myself and my family and to have productive work, you know? But I had too-- I've had too long a history of-- of-- already, by the time I was 16, I was steeped in it, you know? And I think that anybody that's really been kicked around in some fashion, or seen people be kicked around. Hey, that's why, you know, you don't forget it.

**Charlie Rose:** You write very day? I mean, you write frequently?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I wish I did. You know, it's like I-- sometimes I'll go for-- I've gone for long periods of time without writing, you know? And--

**Charlie Rose:** Because you didn't feel it? Because you--

**Bruce Springsteen:** I don't have an idea.

**Charlie Rose:** No idea? No emotion that drives you--

**Bruce Springsteen:** I wish I--

**Charlie Rose:** --to sit down and--

**Bruce Springsteen:** I don't have an idea, or whatever's in there is sort of gestating. You know, it's hard to believe that that's-- you know, but I think that I've gone long periods of time without doing much writing. I've gone through very difficult periods of forcing myself to write. And I think what happens is you move in and out of-- you know, there's different veins, you know? You're sort of-- you're a miner, you know? You're down there mining.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And you hit a vein, and that, you know, goes with you for a very long time. And then it may dry up, and you'll move on to something else. I've written about a lot of different things. And initially, my work, you know, was-- I think, had the social implications through '85, say, and then I-- then I wrote a lot about domestic life and--

**Charlie Rose:** Right. Relationships.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --and relationships. And then I've gone back to doing the other thing with Tom Joad, when I rediscovered that place in myself and--

**Charlie Rose:** Now, what was the impetus for--

**Bruce Springsteen:** --you know?

**Charlie Rose:** --Tom Joad?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I began probably with "Streets of Philadelphia," where Jonathan Demme really called me up and said he had a movie that he was making, and he wanted a song for it. And I knew what the movie was about. I'd read a little bit about it. And I told him I'd give it a shot, and so he sort-of drew me into-- into that kind of work again, really, just by asking, you know? And then--

**Charlie Rose:** "That work" meaning writing songs for movies or--

**Bruce Springsteen:** No, for-- that probably were non-relationship--

**Charlie Rose:** Right. Right. Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --and basically had some sort of social theme--

**Charlie Rose:** Right. Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --in some fashion, you know? He basically drew me-- he really-- that call sort of drew me into it again. And once I did it, I found a great satisfaction in it, and I felt-- Also, it had been about a decade since I'd really written directly about those things, and I think that I felt refreshed. And I'd been living in California for a while and reading a lot of different kinds of stories in the newspaper and traveling up through the central valley to visit my folks, who lived up north. And it was-- it was sort of a-- I saw a lot of the same stories being acted out in different ways, and I-- all of a sudden, that was something I really wanted to write about, so-- and it was about re-finding that place in myself, you know, sort of-- that's really how the song-- Tom Joad really came about. It's about asking yourself. You know, it's not really about-- you know, I used to call a film-- a film director, who's a friend of mine, and he always jokes, "Oh, yeah. Hey, I just wrote, Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?" You know, it's, like, if-- There's an old Preston Sturges pictures Sullivan's Travels--

**Charlie Rose:** Right. Right. Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --where, you know, the movie company wants him to do the Follies of 1939, but he wants to make Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou? So I always call him and say-- because he's made-- "I have a friend who's made Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?" And so he always calls, "Yeah, I think I just-- I think I just wrote Oh, Brother-- you know? But it was-- it was really-- it was something where it was just a dialogue I was having with myself. It was the continuance of those issues being, I think, very urgent issues in society. And I was interested in reconnecting to those things and reconnecting to the part of myself that had written about them.

**Charlie Rose:** Where are you now in terms of what you want to do? I mean, this is, in a sense, an alternative to what--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** --we have seen, you know, and we see the things that were in your head when you wrote other things and what was not included, for whatever reason, you know? What do you want to write about now? What are you writing about?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Oh, I suppose, at the moment, I've had some acoustic music going that basically is an extension of the music I wrote for Tom Joad.

**Charlie Rose:** You like that, don't you?

**Bruce Springsteen:** It's just-- it's just things that fascinate me at the-- I think it's just-- There's stories to tell and it's just what comes-- it's what comes up at a particular moment, you know? But at the same time, I've been working on electric music that-- you know, I've been doing a lot of different things. I haven't really settled on exactly what I'm going to do next. At the moment, I'm waiting to see what presents itself, and then I try to do what I do best. Really, the past six or seven months has been kind of reflective, with the book and--

**Charlie Rose:** The book is looking at-- the book is the songs that-- this is a book of all the songs that you've ever written.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. Yeah, all the released songs, not--

**Charlie Rose:** All the released songs.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --not including these, you know? So I think I spent-- I spent a lot of time sort of recently doing that. Previous to that, I was-- I've been working on some new stuff, and I've just gone back to it, so-- but I don't-- I don't know what it's going to be yet.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah. But it's interesting to-- I mean, what do you think-- you come out of thinking about all the songs and looking at this with these extraordinary photographs that are in here, and-- and this. It does something to your head, in a sense. I mean, if one tends to look at an artist who's doing a retrospective of his work-- I mean, it must fuel some new ideas about "where I came from and where I want to go," you know?

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, it's--

**Charlie Rose:** And it puts you back in touch with roots, and that sometimes you get on the road and you're moving so fast you forget to where you've been.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, actually, that was-- One of the things that I liked about doing this is I came out of a pretty quiet period, as far as just acoustic music was--

**Charlie Rose:** Right. Right.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --was quiet. And so much of my work life was physical and, in a sense, the music was physical, and you were playing loud, and you were-- and that was probably what people remember most, you know, is the intense concerts and--

**Charlie Rose:** The kind of stuff we saw in that video.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. Yeah. And so I think that sort of going back and going through a lot of the music and where that was the essence of what I did on a lot of it was-- part of why I did it was I thought it was something that would reconnect me to that particular feeling, and-- which is something I'm interested in doing right now. I'd like to do something that was a little louder and more-- and more physical.

**Charlie Rose:** A tour?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I don't know. I don't have any-- I'll-- I'm going to dodge that one for you. I've been asked that a few times, you know? I don't have any plans to tour at this particular--

**Charlie Rose:** But you want to.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --moment, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** You want to. Somewhere deep inside, you want--

**Bruce Springsteen:** I like to play, you know? I like to--

**Charlie Rose:** Because you'd like to be loud again. I mean, you're doing--

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah.

**Charlie Rose:** You've been silent. You'd like to be loud again.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah. It's fun.

**Charlie Rose:** And watching this must make you say, you know, "the physical side of me."

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know, it's-- I've always enjoyed-- I've always enjoyed that, and it's the immediacy of it, so it's something I'd enjoy doing, sure.

**Charlie Rose:** Do you have the E Street Band sitting and waiting for you?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I don't know if they're sitting and waiting. They've all got lives of their own, you know? Gary's in Nashville, and he's a producer. He's produced a lot of-- of great records out of Nashville. Clarence is in Florida. I saw him a couple weeks ago. And, you know, Steve's been working on a television show. He's been doing some acting. And Nils has been doing his own touring, and Roy produces in California. They've all got kids now. And, you know, it's a pretty different situation than even 10 years ago. And 10 years ago, when you saw that stuff, none of us-- very few had small children.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And so people have really gone out and made different lives for themselves, and I think-- we had a-- we had a great time and, you know, lifelong-- it's a lifelong relationship--

**Charlie Rose:** You're going to do it.

**Bruce Springsteen:** --and it's something that--

**Charlie Rose:** You're going to do it. You can't--

**Bruce Springsteen:** So, one of these days, we'll get out there.

**Charlie Rose:** It doesn't get in the way of the Stones.

**Bruce Springsteen:** So-- but it's--

**Charlie Rose:** In a second. The E Street Band would be together in a second. I mean, you pick up the phone tonight, and pick up the phone and call Florida and call-- Stevie is where? He's in Hollywood or he's--

**Bruce Springsteen:** He's right around here somewhere.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah, right around here.

**Bruce Springsteen:** He's blocks away, I'm sure. I don't know what he's doing.

**Charlie Rose:** He can hear the sound of your voice. "Come." I mean, you could put this together--

**Bruce Springsteen:** He's watching.

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah, I'm sure he'll be watching tonight and--

**Bruce Springsteen:** He told me he was going to. So--

**Charlie Rose:** He told you what, he was going to be watching? So, what do you say to him? I mean, he's saying to you, you know-- they'd love this, wouldn't they?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I think so, you know? And you know, but--

**Charlie Rose:** Why are you hesitant to announce a new tour on my show? I mean, come on.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Oh, you rascal, you. You rascal, you.

**Charlie Rose:** I mean, it's the littlest, it's-- you know?

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know, I--

**Charlie Rose:** It's a perfect match for you coming here to use my platform-- it's an opportunity to say, "Yes"--

**Bruce Springsteen:** You know, well, we've talked about it over the years, and, if there was something where it's committed, I would say-- you know, but I hate to get into doing something where all of a sudden something doesn't happen, and then everybody's disappointed, including, you know, yourself, so--

**Charlie Rose:** Yeah, exactly, including me.

**Bruce Springsteen:** And myself, you know?

**Charlie Rose:** What has the E Street Band meant to you?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I think that the fundamental thing was-- we did an unusual thing, and really, it's something that-- I don't know if it ever quite existed previously, you know, in the sense that they allowed me to communicate. And I say in the book that they expanded the boundaries and the power of my music by their presence and by their intensity. And they allowed me at night to call up a sense of community and a sense of friendship and a sense-- so when people came in, I think that they invested themselves because they saw themselves, you know? Their friends and their best pal and the guy next door and that was something that I-- that was important. I wanted to create. I wanted to create that community on stage. And that was an essential part, I think, of what I communicated. And I could not have done it without their consistency and dedication and presence, you know? It was really-- They just fueled you, fueled you on a nightly basis. You know, Clarence is always a long-standing source of positive energy and spirit and some missing connection that when we-- when we hit one another in Asbury Park the first night we played together, it was, like, bzzzt. You know, it was just something felt different. And also they-- how many people have you-- do you know still that you knew from when you were, you know, 18 or 19, and that you have sustained relationships with, you know, through good times and rough times. And they're an essential part of your soul and what you do, you know? That was something-- They took my music and made it present and real on a nightly basis, and they stood in for all the people in my songs that I wrote about, you know, the essential relationship-- outside of my family, the most essential relationships of my life, you know? They're very important. Very important.

**Charlie Rose:** Should they have been included in the Hall of Fame?

**Bruce Springsteen:** I think that they definitely-- they need to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, and they-- and I think the Hall of Fame needs to come up with a mechanism that somehow honors musicians, whether it's-- Neil Young did some of his greatest work with Crazy Horse, you know? Whether it's Bill Black, Scotty Moore, D.J. Fontana, who were there at the Sun sessions, you know? At the moment, you know-- I think-- I was very proud of being signed as a solo artist. And I was very proud of the independence. I shaped my career very personally, and that personalness, in the sense of that singular voice, was something that's given my music consistency through 25 years. It's what allowed me-- it's what's allowed me to play that story out. But I couldn't have realized what I did without my band, you know? They were the living realization of many of those ideas, and I think the Hall of Fame needs to come up with a mechanism of some sort that's going to honor musicians in that fashion.

**Charlie Rose:** This is BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, Tracks. This is Songs. I can't tell you how much I am pleased that you're here.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Thank you. I had a great time. I've seen the show very often, and it's interesting to finally see this table up close.

**Charlie Rose:** You're more interested in seeing the table than you were in me.

**Bruce Springsteen:** You're all right, too.

**Charlie Rose:** You're going to perform for us.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Yeah, I'm going to sing a song.

**Charlie Rose:** All right, sing some songs for me. I thank you very much, Bruce. I hope we can do it again.

**Bruce Springsteen:** Thanks. I appreciate it. Thanks.
