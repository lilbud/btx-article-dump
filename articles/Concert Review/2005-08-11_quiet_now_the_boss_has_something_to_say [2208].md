Bruce Springsteen is a storyteller as well as a rocker. But it was his storytelling side that played the dominant role Thursday night at KeyArena.

Currently on his first solo tour since the late '90s -- in support of his current "Devils & Dust" album -- Springsteen played many of the lesser-known songs in his prolific catalog, trotting out such gems as "Highway 29" and "Racing in the Street" with gripping new arrangements and a renewed passion for their lyrical content.

To assure a quiet environment for a solo acoustic show in a large arena, concertgoers were given small instruction cards with do's and don'ts as they came through the doors. Turning off cell phones and refraining from unnecessary chatter were at the top of the list.

Springsteen was almost 45 minutes late in taking the stage, allowing the crowd that filled the main floor and mid-level seats plenty of time to talk themselves out before services at the church of Bruce Springsteen commenced.

"The Boss" arrived on stage in black trousers and a black shirt with sleeves rolled up. Against a backdrop of theater curtains and chandeliers, he greeted fans with a cheerful "Hello Seattleites" and again reminded them of the need for attentive silence. Happy to oblige, the audience was rewarded with more than two hours of powerful, soulful songs that brought out the best in the 55-year-old troubadour, as well as bits of crusty humor, including hilarious remarks about the ambiguous relationship between Fred Flintstone and his friend Barney.

Opening with a stripped-down "Living Proof", he followed with a gritty, distorted version of "Reason to Believe", from his 1980s solo album, "Nebraska", featuring harmonica.

"Devils & Dust" told the desperate tale of a U.S. soldier in Iraq who doesn't know "who to trust." The audience erupted in laughter when Springsteen took a dig at the Bush administration before singing "Part Man, Part Monkey."

When Springsteen's oldest son, Evan, brought his father a fresh guitar, the singer-songwriter wisecracked that it would cost him $100 every time Evan delivered a guitar -- $200 if the audience offered too much encouragement.

"The Rising", his post-9/11 song, was among the most stirring in the main set, and "Racing in the Street" related a captivating tale of men who love fast cars but live desperate lives.

The Grammy-winning Rock and Roll Hall of Famer introduced "Jesus Was an Only Son" with a wonderful story about growing up with his extended family in a Catholic neighborhood whose hub was the church.

Springsteen closed his main set with "Matamoros Banks", the final song on "Devils & Dust." He returned for two encores, making a pitch for the West Seattle Food Bank and ending with such songs as "Promised Land" and an amazing "Dream Baby Dream."

Springsteen's long night in Seattle ended just before 10:40 p.m.
