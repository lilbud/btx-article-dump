BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN At: the Orpheum Theatre last night; through tonight

Bozo the fan yelled to Bruce Springsteen during a silent moment, early in the two-hour set, last night: "Welcome back, Boss!"

Springsteen to Bozo: "Aw, shaddup."

This really happened. As did a post-first song lecture about how his new songs were written -- "with a lot of silence" -- and what proper audience behavior consisted of -- "I don't need any whistling or cheers to let me know how well or poorly I'm doing." Later, a Bozette yells: "I love you, Bruce!"

Springsteen: "Too much love drives a man insane." Another star-struck scream gets this from the ponytailed man on stage, no longer a memeber of the torn, tight blue jeans club for men: "I don't get any pleasure out of that, darlin'." He welcomed an "audience police" that would turn to the annoying unwashed and ask them to "Shut the {expletive} up."

Santa Claus did not come to town last night at the Orpheum Theatre. Dollars to dimes, he won't be there tonight, either. Even with Springsteen -- whose "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" has been a seasonal treat for nearly two decades -- at center court. The thing is, it's a relatively hushed court. It's reinvention time. Anthemic, uplifting Bruce is on holiday; somber, sober- minded, story-song slinger Bruce is plucking away acoustically, blowing harp and singing about death, blood and guts and not a whole lot of redemptive possibility. There ain't no "barefoot girl sittin' on the hood of a Dodge, drinking warm beer in the soft summer sun." There ain't any talk of "Better Days." These days, there's a guy blown up in a crystal-meth lab, "men walkin" long the railroad tracks/Goin' someplace there's no goin' back", and a whole bunch of folks out of work, squashed by corporate greed and indifference.

A telltale sign that even the most wide-eyed of Springsteen's following was figuring this out last night: The calls of "BROOOOCE!" subsided in number and volume as the night went on.

Springsteen's latest album, "The Ghost of Tom Joad", is the centerpiece of this small-theater tour -- that and radical reworkings of songs such as "Adam Raised a Cain", "Darkness on the Edge of Town" and "Born in the USA."

So, you're thinking, what got in his tea? Sure, he took us down the the grim American underbelly with "Nebraska" in 1982, but with this one's he's turned the palette from dark gray to coal black. The light bits, generally, come in the between-song gab, or, at the end of the set, with the florid "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" from his first album and "This Hard Land" from his 'Greatest Hits."

Perhaps, "Steets of Philadelphia", played as an encore last night, forced him down a path of no return. Perhaps, he heard Warren Zevon's "The Indifference of Heaven" where Zevon, (via a desperate stickup man) chides his old collaborator (they co-wrote "Jeannie Needs a Shooter") singing that those who proclaim better days are coming, "they don't live around here -- Bruce and Patti don't." Maybe, Springsteen picked up the gauntlet. Or maybe he just, again, realized like Neil Young (with "Tonight's the Night") and Lou Reed (with "Berlin"), that success grants a certain artistic license to brood, to work with dark areas not usually part of the pop terrain.

For Springsteen, last night's show was nothing less than deconstruction, bordering on catalog deletion. And, there's some bitter irony there. That catalog made him the rich, well-respected man that he is; he certainly doesn't think an unknown artist who put out "Tom Joad" would be packing the Orpheum for two nights at $30 a ticket. No, the fans were there because of the legacy, the memories of good times and the hope that Springsteen would wrest some pleasure out of these painful songs.

He did. Not consistently -- and especially not near the end where the toll became wearing. When Springsteen's protagonist-mule swallowed the balloon of cocaine, I almost laughed. We know Bruce favors the working man, but another (after "Sinaloa Cowboys") messed-up drug guy we're to sympathize with?

Springsteen almost double-timed it through "Darkness on the Edge of Town"turning it strident and clamorous. "Adam Raised a Cain" had a whole new melody. The most striking reconfiguration was, as promised, "Born in the USA"which Springsteen introduced as part of a line of misinterpeted songs from "Louie, Louie" to "This Land Is My Land." Mostly, those who got it wrong, he said were, "young children and Republicans." That brought a chuckle, but for Bruce not to bear part of the blame is a tad disingenuous. It was styled as a major-chord rock anthem; its chorus sounds proud and resonant; the album cover features Old Glory (and Bruce's be-jeaned butt). The hapless grunt sent to kill "the yellow man" in Vietnam is full of rage, but you have to fight against the spirit of the chorus to get there and not want to wave a (tattered) flag. It is more work than most fans want to give it, and Springsteen probably should have considered that when he wrote it.

Last night, Springsteen stripped away the chorus and rejiggered it via slide guitar as a mean country-blues song. Go ahead, Ronald Reagan, make my day!

Find the jingoism in that.

Springsteen's sentiments are pretty much always noble, liberal, on the side of the working man, not the shareholders. "Youngstown", about laborers no longer needed in today's age, hit home and hit hard.

He doesn't pretend to be the answer man; fame hasn't made him put up blinders to those who less fortunate; he's, obviously, chosen the hard way over the easy way, as an artist. Heck, he even admits to finding out about Tom Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath" from the John Ford movie, not the John Steinbeck novel.

No elitism there. But last night's set suffered from good intentions -- too long, too much compassion fatigue -- and was bogged down, frankly, by songwriting that is just too linear. One doesn't demand the epic sweep of a "Jungleland", the spine-tingling jolts of a "Candy's Room" or the timeless pop lilt of a "Because the Night." But, sonically speaking, you wanted hints of these things, more than the bare-bones folkie framework Springsteen offered.
