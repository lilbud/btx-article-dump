**TUESDAY NOVEMBER 18, 1975**

In the evening I go with Nancy to the Bruce Springsteen concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. This is the first show outside the US for a 26 year old Jersey Boy who has been hailed as the new Dylan, Lennon, Van Morrison and so on. The trouble is that the enormous reputation has been chiefly created by CBS Records and there is a certain skepticism around as to the legendariness of Springsteen. So, was this the new Messiah ?

Was this to be one of those concerts that fathers tell their sons about in years to come ?

Of course, the concert didn't start until fourty five minutes after the advertised time-and we kept having wretched announcements about it being your last chance to get cigarettes and smokes before the concert began. The air inside the Odeon was so foul and heavy that this was hardly doing anyone a favor.

Nor did Springsteen start too well. A solo with piano. His croaking straining voice sounding as though he had just done a six week Gumby season- the spotlights all over the place. No, definitely no magic until the full six piece band strolled on and everyone was riveted by the white suit and matching white trilby of the tubby, middle aged sax player, Clarence Clemmons.

The band went off at such a lick that one could sense the relief. Springsteen leapt into action-twitching and leaping and throwing himself into strange spasms as he urged the band on. The sound system failed to make head nor tail of Springsteen's poetry, but the band kept the evening alive -and he did three encores.

Afterwards -a party given by CBS in the balcony bar. Talked with John Walters, a very funny man....Final word on Springsteen from Walters -

"We came expecting the Messiah but we got Billy Graham instead."

" An interesting film idea via Angela Elbourne. A proposal that I should be seen in the US trying to track down Bruce Springsteen; using his songs as an excuse to visit various parts of the US; viz Asbury Park. In the end, we would meet and exchange whatever. The idea that intrigued the authors of this proposal is the difference between English public-school middle class comedy writer and American working class rock idol - or the similarity.
