Wailers fail to catch afire

NEW YORK: I'd like to say that the Wailers were a fantastic success at their opening set at Max's but this wouldn't be strictly accurate; not because they weren't good, simply that reggae has not yet achieved any real momentum in America.

Generally, The Harder They Come has not made much impact in the States, and neither has its star, Jimmy Cliff.

It's been the reggae-orientation of Johnny Nash and the dabblings of such as Paul Simon and J. Geils which have registered Jamaican music, but only to the point where the general public thinks of it as a novelty.

Thus, although the Wailers arrived fresh from an apparently triumphant residency in Boston, they found themselves playing to largely unconverted ears at Max's, and, with virtually no exception, white ears.

To compound matters, most of the audience was there for Columbia's new rising star, Bruce Springsteen, While the seated policy of the club was hardly conducive to a natural, bodily response to what's essentially dance music.

This is not to make too many apologies, however, for the Wailers, who were rather stiff for most of their set. In fact, Bob Marley sounded somewhat thin and unconvincing on lead vocals.

In all truth, they didn't appear to be enjoying themselves, and this reserve held back their music, which if anything relies heavily on its infectiousness.

There aren't many of us who aren't West Indians that have been exposed much to live reggae, so it's difficult to place the Wailers in a critical context.

But, although it may be a little unfair to use them as a test case for a whole musical culture, they've made a lot of friends and alienated no-one. It's a start.

Bruce Springsteen has not only started, he's fully emerged within the space of four months. His first album resembled the manic outpourings of an autistic child, but there's never any doubt in my mind that he's an original talent.

Those who've dismissed him have simply never seen him.

He and his band --- with more than a passing reference to the giant black tenorist, Clarence Clemmons --- are the most voluble and exciting club act to have appeared this year.

Springsteen, with his half-smiling, befuddled air, still sounds like he's spent time in a mental institution, but that impression only heightens the desperate, tumbled intensity of his performance.

He plays spirited guitar on uptempo numbers, but he's more particularly effective on piano, where he employs his more reflective songs (there was an especially involving one about growing up in Asbury Park, N.J., where he lives).

His lyrics are invariably oblique --- hardly narrative --- and he would benefit only by not straining after effect and crowding image upon image. As an artist he still hasn't defined himself, but when he's learned to discipline the neurotic impulse that forces him into a kind of absurd speed writing Without losing his fierce compulsiveness, he'll have something major to say.

As it is, he's an arresting talent who expresses himself best live, where this jarring note is passed over in the physicality of the music. He's a lot of fun, too.
