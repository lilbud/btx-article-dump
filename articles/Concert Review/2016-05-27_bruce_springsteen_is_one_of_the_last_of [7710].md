The kind of guy you'd really like to know better: Springsteen opens his UK tour

It takes a perverse sense of logic to serenade a crowd with Santa Claus Is Coming To Town in May, but Bruce Springsteen isn't one for strict convention, seasonal or otherwise. The opening night of his UK tour saw him raise the spirits of a damp and drizzly Manchester with an unexpected rendition of the Christmas novelty number, little over 15 minutes into his mammoth three-hour set.

He really needn't have bothered. Springsteen's ace card is his everyman appeal, a performer with a natural rapport with his audience and an undeniable knack for an air-punching chorus. It's a feelgood quality that feels utterly free of contrivance. For all his squillions of record sales, the live arena is where he and his band truly excel.

He didn't need much of an excuse on this occasion, going off on a prolonged walkabout into the throng during a pumping Hungry Heart, glad-handing the punters like a returning king. "Manchester we've got a crush on you!" he yelled, grinning from one ear to the other as he returned to the stage.

Springsteen was here, ostensibly, to perform The River, the sprawling 1980 opus that lit the touchpaper that fired him from cultish songwriter to global superstar for a decade. The title track was particularly affecting. Bookended by some windblown harmonica, it swiftly became a dialogue with the crowd, Springsteen breaking from the verses to hold the mic aloft as the lyrics were sung back at him in a vast wave, a spontaneous communique between the adoring and the adored. Point Blank was beautiful too, a showcase for Roy Bittan to demonstrate the elegant economy of his piano lines.

Bittan has been at Bruce's side since Born To Run, for the most part, and is emblematic of the kind of loyalty Springsteen seems to inspire. The seven- piece band, be it Nils Lofgren turning circles during a solo or fellow guitarist Steve Van Zandt barking a call and response with Springsteen at stage centre, clearly had a blast too.

There was an ecstatic Johnny 99, on which The Boss's Chuck Berry riff served as an invitation for each member of the group to take a moment under the lights. The goodtime vibes reached a peak with Waiting On a Sunny Day. As the rain continued to fall, Springsteen brought a 12-year-old girl out from the crowd (wielding a placard saying she wanted to hear said song) and embarked on a duet that drew a huge roar of appreciation. He may look like a tough in a Scorcese movie, but he invariably came across as the kind of guy you'd really like to know better.

If this show proved anything, it's that Springsteen is a master of structure, peppering the set with anthems that prevented the more understated moments from sagging. Out On The Street was as striking as it was concise. Darlington County was terrific, as was Because The Night, the song he wrote for Patti Smith in the late Seventies.

But the first encore took proceedings to a new level. His version of Backstreets was simply immense, replete with a Bruce guitar solo as impassioned as it was descriptive. And Born To Run remains arguably the most irresistible weapon in his arsenal. Glory Days was a reminder of his Eighties pomp, delivered with a conviction that, two and a half hours in, was little short of astonishing.

Given the recent demise of Prince, it's poignant to note that Springsteen is one of the last great showmen of his era still doing his thing, the raw power of his stage persona undimmed by age or time. To say nothing of his music.
