Two months into his tour in support of "The Rising", Bruce Springsteen is still finding his way: to the complicated heart of his new songs and to a new sort of connection with his audience. And that's precisely how it should be.

Not only the set list but the very soul of the show was dominated by material from the new album, a catalog of pain and faith that emerged from the wreckage of Sept. 11. Springsteen can no longer rely on the familiar combustability; archetypal anthems and passionate power chords are no longer the matter of the day. So the artist is searching for that elusive place on the concert stage where the weight of the world and desires of his fans converge.

He's making an admirable go of it. With every member of the E Street Band in black, the show opened with the galvanizing title song off "The Rising"followed by the disc's opening track, the rootsy "Lonesome Day." Both are inspired by grief but anchored in hope and the redemptive power of community.

Fans seemed at a loss as to what to do with their arms and vocal cords - both of which are generally in constant use during a Springsteen show. But his following is nothing if not devoted, and seemed to appreciate his solemn effort to make sense of the senseless, even if it didn't always translate to the transcendent performance they've come to expect.

Powerfully mournful songs like "The Fuse" and "Empty Sky" - during which the lyric "I want an eye for an eye" elicited cheers from the crowd - were peppered with loose, feel-good chestnuts. The youthful muscularity of "Prove It All Night" and the joyous revelry of "The Promised Land" sometimes felt like jarring shifts on the heels of "You're Missing" - a heart-rending portrait of loss sung with eyes closed, open hands raised. But the concert wound up feeling strangely cohesive, with new and old songs like the sides of a coin: terrible trials eased by the salve of human connection.

"Waitin' On a Sunny Day", the brightest ray of hope on the new album, was performed a third of the way through last night's set, and it worked like a tonic on Springsteen. He seemed to remember he had a body, and began dancing and smiling, cascading across the stage on his knees, and doing a deep back- bend to accompany Clarence Clemens's churning saxophone solo. But the most potent reminder of just how strong a thread runs through old and new came via the back- to-back punch of "Badlands" and "She's the One", when 20,000 spirits lifted en mass. The defiance and release of those songs made a riveting case for the healing power of rock 'n' roll.

Springsteen, who participated in ceremonies at the Leonard P. Zakim Bridge yesterday afternoon, dedicated "My Hometown" to the Zakim family, describing him as "a guy who did all the things I sing about." Springsteen, too, has become the guy he sings about - articulating our feelings with compassion and grace.
