Roaring into the Times Union Center on Tuesday night after a weeklong hiatus, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band headed back into their High Hopes tour recharged and rocking hard, opening with a cover of INXS' "Don't Change."

They tore nonstop through another half dozen tunes before Springsteen had a chance to catch his breath and welcome the sold-out crowd.

Since making his Capital Region debut at Union College 40 years ago, Springsteen's calling card has been the arena-rock anthem, a rousing call-to- action that's guaranteed to get the crowd out of their seats and onto their feet.

The anthems still ring true, but there's really no need for him to pour out the boundless energy that he did on Tuesday.

The crowd was with him from the start, and the show was particularly interactive, as he plucked fans out of the audience four times to dance with him on stage. "This is a serious night of audience participation", he told the crowd, "What's got into you?"

One of the most cinematic storytellers of the rock era, Springsteen's lyrics are awash in both detail and atmosphere.

Mixing politics and poetry into his riveting narratives, he's perhaps the best U.S. musical historian of the past half-century.

And whether it was the Depression-era Dust Bowl (cribbed equally from Woody Guthrie and John Steinbeck in "The Ghost of Tom Joad"), the Vietnam War (the solemn "The Wall", his most personal song of the night) or the still-open wound of the 9/11 terrorist attacks ("The Rising"), Springsteen made America's tragedies deeply personal, and yet somehow hopeful.

An hour into the nearly three-hour show, the sweat-soaked Springsteen testified, "Are you ready to be transformed, Albany?" And indeed, it was a transformative performance, the 17-piece band pumping through the hits ("Born in the USA", "Born to Run" and "Dancing in the Dark" as a string of encores), album tracks ("This Is Your Sword" and "Better Days" were standouts), a choice selection of covers (notably Roy Head's '60s soul nugget "Treat Her Right" and a rousing, almost Dixieland version of the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive") and the iconic "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out" (as a tribute to the late saxman Clarence Clemons).

Springsteen is undeniably the architect, but the E Street Band - inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame just last month - has always been the rock-solid foundation around which the songs are built, much in the same way that Duke Ellington wrote songs with his specific band members in mind. And while numerous band members have fallen by the wayside over the years --- these days, bassist Garry Tallent is the only remaining original member - the sheer sonic force and the inherent drama of the band is still intact.

Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello (filling Steve Van Zandt's slot while he's off filming his Netflix series "Lilyhammer") is a powerful addition to the band, especially on his duet with Springsteen on "The Ghost of Tom Joad", brimming over with defiance and electro-shock guitar.

After ripping through "Treat Her Right", Springsteen just shook his head and said, "The song has magic in it. Magic, I tell you." And the same goes for the rest of the performance, too.
