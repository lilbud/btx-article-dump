Bruce Springsteen casts a giant shadow.

As he strummed the opening chords of "The Rising" Saturday night at Pepsi Arena, a spotlight illuminated him from behind, projecting his image against the back wall of the venue four stories high. It just seemed right.

The show marked Springsteen's first-ever solo appearance in the region after years of making regular tour stops with his E Street Band.

The purpose of this "solo acoustic" jaunt, of course, is to showcase his new album, "Devils & Dust."

He offered the title tune three songs into his long show, and then surveyed much of the rest of the album of throughout the evening -- including a bright "All The Way Home", a loose, chatty "Jesus was an Only Son" and the mesmerizing "Leah."

He dedicated "Long Time Comin'" from "Devils" to his son, Evan, who was in the house with a friend, Tyler. The buddy was on the receiving end of a dedication for "Silver Palomino."

Springsteen smiled at the boys when he was finished.

The controversial "Reno", which illustrates a brokenhearted man's episode with a hooker, was less laser-focused than on the album, and it marked the only moment in the show that Springsteen didn't seem a slave to his muse.

The aforementioned "The Rising" found that focus and then some. It seemed as though Springsteen channeled the song.

Longtime fans had plenty to celebrate. Springsteen (who was abetted by some recorded tracks) moved between a variety of guitars and pianos for songs from throughout his career.

Some, like "Reason to Believe" and "Spare Parts", were radically rearranged as gritty blues numbers. The former was delivered as a Beefheartian boot stomp, with a wheezing harp snaking between the lines. The latter was a slide-guitar rave-up with overtones of Leadbelly and Big Joe Williams.

The rarity "Part Man, Part Monkey" was given an electric reading, with evolutionary commentary.

Later, during the encores, Springsteen also offered a refashioned "Promised Land" that traded the original's drive for a newfound emotion.

Fans seemed especially appreciative when their hero sat down at the keys \- whether responding to the opening pump organ drone of "Into the Fire" or cheering for "Human Touch's" "The Real World."

He introduced "The Promise" by saying, "I haven't played this in awhile", and then chuckled at his own keyboard fumbling during the tune.

He closed the set proper with a deep reading of the border song "Matamoros Banks" and finished off the encores, as he has on most nights of the tour, with a haunting pump organ cover of Suicide's "Dream Baby Dream."
