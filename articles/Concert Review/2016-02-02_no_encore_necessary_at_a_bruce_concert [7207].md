Bruce Springsteen specializes in heart-busting, big-life-moment songs told from the perspective of someone who knows time is short so you better make every second - and every song - count.

Also every concert.

The iconic New Jersey heartland rocker gave us over three hours of total passion and commitment at the Air Canada Centre, in support of his The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set, which celebrates the 35th anniversary of 1980's The River, a four-album effort that he and his nine-piece E Street Band played front to back.

The final chords of one song barely finished ringing out before The Boss, looking lean, tanned and handsome in hues of black and grey (and his trademark jeans), counted in the next one with gusto.

Occasionally he offered up an intro. Independence Day, he said, was about being stunned by the discovery of your parents' humanity, of realizing for the first time that they once had dreams of their own. "It's a song about adult compromises", he said, "and the blessings those compromises brought."

Uplift immediately returned with the familiar opening notes of Hungry Heart, especially when he held back for the first verse and let us sing it on our own.

The continued push-pull between serious and fun, between dark and light, between sprawling "compositions" and lighter-weight fare - Crush On You, You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch) - was hugely satisfying.

And after so many Behind The Music-type rock band documentaries, it was great to see seemingly genuine playfulness among the musicians onstage, many of whom have been in the E Street Band since the 70s and 80s. With drummer Max Weinberg and bassist Garry Tallent holding down a steady backbeat, the others harmonized and soloed and did cute little moves in sync.

Blazing saxophone is as fundamental to Springsteen's sound as lonesome harmonica, and Jake Clemons, nephew of deceased E Street member Clarence Clemons, captivated, especially on an epic rendition of The Price You Pay, one of the set's standout numbers. Guitarists Patti Scialfa and Little Steven Van Zandt turned out powerful harmonies all night, often sharing the centre mic with Springsteen and appearing on the Jumbo screens.

Crowd interaction was also high. Springsteen regularly left the singing to us, lighters came out during gorgeously melancholy The River, and an 89-year-old woman celebrating her birthday got the chance to waltz with The Boss during Dancing In The Dark during the greatest-hits portion of the set as her elated daughter looked on.

Despite the concert already being two hours deep by that point, it was that greatest hits section that offered up some of the most energetic moments.

The Promised Land (requested via a sign held high) hit hard. Patti Smith Group's Because The Night, which Smith co-wrote with Springsteen, was a mind- blowing surprise, his version more triumphant than Smith's during her last few visits to Toronto and featuring a dazzling, almost comically lengthy guitar solo by Nils Lofgren that ended with him shredding while spinning around and around in a spotlight.

Bridge In Disguise was gorgeous, with a slightly changed chorus melody. The crowd lost its mind during Badlands, Born To Run and the aforementioned Dancing In The Dark.

We hit the three-hour mark. "Are you ready to continue?" Springsteen shouted.

"Are you ready to continue?"

Ready or not, he gave us Rosalita and a cover of the Isley Brothers' Shout, which he repeatedly extended in an almost compulsive way. "I'm just a prisoner of rock and roll!" he shouted, almost apologetically
