Crowd-surfing by the fourth song (Hungry Heart) and taking requests by the fifth (Blinded by the Light), Bruce Springsteen proved he's still the Boss last night by letting a packed, jubilant Nationwide Arena crowd order him around. (Plus high-five and/or lightly grope him, if you got close enough to attempt a selfie.)

He proved it all night, you might say, or at least a long-enough portion of the night (three hours and change) for a highly adrenalized devotee to hypothetically take a last-chance power drive from here to Detroit, and possibly back.

Adrenaline is his medium, whether he's giving us what we want (the immortal whoa-oh-oh orgies of Badlands and, yes, Born to Run) or what we need (the hard-times catharsis of sneaky-great 2012 single Wrecking Ball). Even touring behind a bum album (January's spotty High Hopes) and with his freshly Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inducted E Street Band down some key personnel (fancy-pants rap-rock guitarist Tom Morello subbing for Stevie Van Zandt, and dearly departed sax man Clarence Clemons' shoes capably filled by nephew Jake Clemons), Springsteen didn't so much bring the house down as he inverted it and shook vigorously.

Morello, the '90s-beloved, wah-wah-pedal-loving ex-Rage against the Machine ax-wielder, is far better suited to this company in person. His goofy, incongruous solo on a reworked The Ghost of Tom Joad --- Gen X graffiti artlessly scrawled on John Steinbeck's grave --- nearly torpedoes High Hopes all on its own.

But the Nationwide crowd ate his exuberance up, and somehow turned a disaster into a showstopper. American Skin (41 Shots), the somber and brave 2001 tribute to NYPD shooting victim Amadou Diallo now given a fresh, grim, racially charged relevance by the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, hit just as hard and made the new record worth revisiting, the house's cooler reception aside.

But that's arguably what we need --- what we want is multiple exuberant crowd members of wildly varying ages yanked onstage for Dancing in the Dark, or Bruce's mic-humping adult-yoga pose as Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out roared to life, or the cowbell- and horn-driven joy bomb of Johnny 99.

"Columbus!" roared the Boss deep into the night. "Do! You! Have! Any! Thing!

Left!?" We did, and so did he, and the whoa-oh-oh'ing and light groping began anew.

We shut it down with Shout! --- yes, the Shout! from Animal House, and probably your wedding --- though getting a little softer now was not an option.
