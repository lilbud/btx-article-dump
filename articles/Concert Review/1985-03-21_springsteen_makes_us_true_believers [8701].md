At his first Sydney concert, on March 21, the 'saviour of rock and roll', Bruce Springsteen, gathered more true believers.

For years we've been hearing about the saviour of rock and roll - Bruce Springsteen - that he was the greatest rock and roll performer of our time.

The superlatives for Springsteen never seem to stop. Could the mythic proportions of his reputation be true?

Well, I'm sure after Springsteen's first Australian concert on Thursday night at Sydney's Entertainment Centre, there are many true believers.

Sydney has never seen a finer and more spirited show (nor is it likely to for some time). Springsteen played for 3 hours and 20 minutes. Not for one second did the energy levels wane.

He sang with gut-wrenching conviction, played guitar, played harmonica, jumped into the first rows of the audience, leapt on top of the piano, slid across the stage, on his knees and by interval we thought we had seen a great concert. But after interval Springsteen just got better and better.

He had the audience totally captured, whether he was doing the rockier songs like Prove It All Night, Badlands, Cover Me and Dancing in the Dark (during which, as in the video, a lucky girl from the front rows gets a chance to dance with The Boss), or whether he was doing the more emotional ballads like Atlantic City, Reason To Believe, Racing in the Streets and his Vietnam song Shut Out the Light, when there was total enraptured silence.

He has a wonderful rapport with the audience, and introduces many of his songs with witty or poignant stories. He is just as good a storyteller in words as he is in song.

While Springsteen has had a strong following in the US for more than 10 years, much of his popularity was based on his stagecraft. His fame really exploded in this country with the single and video of Dancing in the Dark.

One could expect a majority of the audience to be only familiar with his Born in the USA material, but there was a vast cross section of ages at the concert and his older songs were greeted with as much enthusiasm as his new ones. Even Springsteen seemed surprised when the audience started to sing along to Thunder Road, which is from his 1975 album Born To Run.

The members of his E. Street Band are as legendary as The Boss - there was Roy Bittan on piano, Danny Federici on keyboards, Garry Tallent on bass, Max Weinberg on drums, Nils Lofgren on guitar and, of course, the great Clarence Clemons on saxophone. They are all consummate musicians and Springsteen works in well with them, all at ease from playing so many years together.

Springsteen did two long encores with Born To Run, I'm A Rocker and Mitch Ryder ' s Detroit Medley (Devil With A Blue Dress, Good Golly Miss Molly and Jenny Take A Ride).

Springsteen is so brilliant because he has an undying belief in the cause of rock and roll. There's no cynicism; for him, like the early rock and rollers, it's the kind of experience that changes your life.
