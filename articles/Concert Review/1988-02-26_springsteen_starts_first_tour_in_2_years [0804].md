Bruce Springsteen wants to grow up, settle down and remind his huge audience that there's no escape from responsibility. "One of the hardest things for me over the past 10 years", he said Thursday as he introduced and partly disavowed a song from 1975, "Born to Run", "has been trying to understand what growing up and being a man is all about - trying to make some kind of home for myself and then trying to hold on to it."

But he also wants to rock out, and for Mr. Springsteen, the two goals are almost always at odds. In the opening show of his first United States tour since 1986, which immediately sold out the 13,000-seat Centrum here, he did his duty by the somber, fatalistic ballads about uncertain love and diminishing prospects that have filled his albums since the 1978 "Darkness on the Edge of Town." And a supercharged rock and soul finale turned the last half-hour of the nearly three-hour show into a rip-roaring, cinderblock- shaking jubilee.

Mr. Springsteen's past tours have earned him a reputation for indefatigable showmanship and anthemic sing-alongs. The current tour still includes dramatic monologues, songs not available on his albums, sing-alongs, oldies, occasional band shtick and a re-enactment of the "Dancing in the Dark" video clip. Once he had documented his concerts on the five-LP set "Live: 1975-1985", however, Mr. Springsteen scaled down the arrangements and changed subjects for his 1987 album, "Tunnel of Love." His early albums were about boyish dreams; his next ones were about men's work; "Tunnel of Love" is about men and women who are in love or married but not living happily ever after. Most of the songs are midtempo ballads or pop-rock hymns: ruminations on love, not anthems.

Mr. Springsteen performed eight songs from "Tunnel of Love", and from the rest of his catalogue, with a few exceptions (including a searing version of "Seeds", about migrant workers stranded by the Texas oil bust), he's chosen songs about relationships rather than economic troubles. Where he used to end his concerts with, "I'm a prisoner of rock-and-roll", he now shouts, "I'm a prisoner of love!"

Most of the songs have an earnest, troubled tone, and it's not easy to build a rock-and-roll show around them. The music is solid and assured. Mr. Springsteen plays cutting lead-guitar lines, and his E Street Band and a five- man horn section recruited from the Asbury Jukes fill out the arrangements with warm keyboard sounds and horn-section chords.

Mr. Springsteen has taken to heart his responsibilities as a mass-audience performer. Unfortunately, his good intentions can make him didactic. Where his older songs were kaleidoscopic in everything from vocal delivery to arrangements to wordplay, his newer songs are virtually monochromatic; Mr. Springsteen stands still, sings in one tone \- a moan or a rasp or a choked- back croon - and links images to deliver a parable. The songs are well made, with memorable keyboard mottoes and telling images, but their earnestness undermines them.

Mr. Springsteen hasn't entirely misplaced his sense of humor. In the second half of the concert he came up with "Part Man, Part Monkey", a reggae-style defense of Darwin, and "I'm a Coward When It Comes to Love", which crossbreeds "Rockin' Pneumonia" and Gino Washington's "Gino Is a Coward" and states his latest themes with comic hyperbole. He also reclaimed his own "Light of Day" from the Paul Schrader film, and for his encores he revived the wild, woolly "Rosalita" and a soul-oldie medley including "Devil With a Blue Dress On", "Shake" and more. By then he was racing around the stage and even dancing on Roy Bittan's piano.

Clearly, Mr. Springsteen is grappling with the demands of maturity. Songs like "Part Man, Part Monkey" suggest that, at least part of the time, he knows he doesn't have to be solemn to be serious.
