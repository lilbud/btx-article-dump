It was a night of two Bruces Wednesday at the Tacoma Dome.

The first was anguished yet hopeful, performing songs from his new album, "The Rising" about the mood of post-Sept. 11 America.

The second was wildly exuberant, reminiscent of his 1980s heyday and the unabashed optimism of that era.

In a 2 1/2-hour show featuring the reunited E Street Band, the two sides of Bruce Springsteen came together in a powerful, inspirational performance.

Yet despite the new chart-topping album, attendance was down. The Tacoma Dome can hold more than 20,000, but only 13,000 turned out. Those with extra tickets before the show had a tough time finding buyers. Indoors, entire upper seating sections went unused, and a curtain divided the room.

Nevertheless, the faithful made their presence known. Concertgoers began chanting "Bruuuuce!" shortly after the scheduled start time of 7:30 p.m.

Springsteen and the E Street Band finally arrived onstage at 8:17.

It was worth the wait. Springsteen performed nearly two dozen songs, sticking closely to a set list he has followed in other cities on the tour, adding a couple of cherished songs from the past -- a "classic" version of "Dancing in the Dark" and the rocking old favorite "Ramrod."

This wasn't a greatest-hits show, but there were plenty of hand-clapping, arm- waving favorites to send fans into ecstasy.

Wearing a blue work shirt, black jeans and black oxfords and sporting a few days' stubble, Springsteen could have been a man snatched from an unemployment line.

Backing him -- and sounding terrific -- were E Streeters Clarence Clemons, Steven Van Zandt, Roy Bittan, Nils Lofgren and Max Weinberg.

Springsteen opened with "The Rising", the bold title track from a new album reflecting the pain, suffering and heroism related to the terrorist attacks.

Wife Patti Scialfa and guitarist Van Zandt joined Springsteen on vocals, leaning into the microphone with anguished expressions.

"Lonesome Day" was followed by "Prove It All Night" and "The Fuse", a darkly sexual but life-affirming new song. Springsteen's face was eerily bathed in red light as the song came to a close. He followed with the moody "Darkness on the Edge of Town."

Springsteen didn't say much during the first half of the show, which was filled with the dark stories of Sept. 11. But later he loosened up.

"It's nice to be back in Tacoma", he said. "I spent a week here one night. I got so sick."

The crowd laughed at the reference to Springsteen's bout with the flu during a 1984 appearance at the Dome.

The New Jersey-bred rocker then asked for "some quiet" for two songs from the new album, the devastatingly sad and moving "Empty Sky" and "You're Missing."

The latter was about a firefighter killed in the World Trade Center attacks.

He and Scialfa sang together on the former tune; guest musician Soozie Tyrell was featured on violin on the latter.

The mood was more upbeat on another song, "Waitin' on a Sunny Day", which prompted an audience singalong.

"The Promised Land" led right into "Worlds Apart", recorded for the new album with Pakistani qwali singer Asif Ali Khan. The live version of the latter, a lament about cultural divides, featured Springsteen and Scialfa on vocals and was extended by a lengthy jam.

The old Bruce returned with a rousing, guitar-heavy "Badlands" and continued with the party songs "Bobby Jean" and the new "Mary's Place."

"Are you ready for a Tacoma-style house party?" Springsteen said, beaming.

He introduced the E Street Band as "the greatest house band in the whole world." When he got to wife, Scialfa, he described her lovingly as "my natural Viagra."

The band resumed playing the exuberant "Mary's Place", with Springsteen shouting "Turn it up! Turn it up!" to the dancing, cheering crowd. "Countin' On a Miracle", "Thunder Road" and the melancholy "Into the Fire" closed the main set.

Springsteen and company returned for the first of two encores, performing the uplifting "Dancing in the Dark", the hard-partying, butt-shaking "Ramrod" and the anthemic "Born to Run."

During his second encore, Springsteen sat down at the piano to perform the inspirational "My City of Ruins", his most powerful post-Sept. 11 song.

"C'mon, rise up!" he sang, as the crowd went into a frenzy.

Springsteen made a plug for Tacoma's Food Lifeline and spoke about the importance of civil rights and due process.

"It goes with the turf when you're born in the U.S.A.", he said before launching into the classic "Born in the U.S.A." Like other songs of his heyday, it has held up well and still packs a wallop.

Springsteen and the E Street Band finished the show with "Land of Hope and Dreams", tying together the many themes and emotions of his vast musical repertoire.
