Three blocks from Pac Bell Park on the anniversary of Elvis' death Saturday, a small congregation took over Burger Island. Two rows of tables pressed together and littered with paper baskets containing veggie burgers and Coca- Cola cups were clearly reserved. Two laminated tags proclaimed, in bold black letters, "The Church of Bruce." Three other round tables near the front window were more specific. "This Train: Northern California's Springsteen Fans", read white sheets of paper tucked under ketchup and mustard bottles.

A group of 30-plus fans met in 1999 after reading a posted invitation for Bay Area Springsteen fans on a now-defunct Web site. What started out as a tailgate party has turned into something like a support group for classic rock 'n' roll fans. Whether they gather in a parking lot, pizza parlor or burger joint, they use the few hours before a Bruce show to chat about the one thing they have in common: Springsteen love.

Billy Bradford, 47, of Castro Valley, is the leader of this itinerant church. By profession, he is an information systems manager for a law firm. By calling, he is enamored of all things Springsteen. A freckled, thin man in silver-rimmed glasses with a cell phone holstered on his snug blue jeans, Bradford says he likes sincere songwriters -- and Bruce is the epitome of sincerity. He first heard Springsteen in 1975 and has been a fan ever since. Whenever Springsteen is "west of Texas, basically", Bradford snatches up tickets from backstreets.com.

"A lot of times when you're young, the words might mean something like 'I love you', " Bradford says. "But he was telling stories, and if you pay attention, some of these songs can make you cry. Music had never done that for me before."

As Frank McCourt wrote about last week's blackout in New York, everyone has a story about where they were when name-the-event happened. Here, talk revolves around tour dates, Bruce sightings, T-shirts and lyrics. Although many seem to be in their 40s with children or new poodles, they represent a variety of professions, from teaching to advertising. They love all kinds of music, from Cher to Good Charlotte. Except for, and maybe because of, the fact that some of them organize their vacations to see Bruce and friends and family all over the country when he's on tour, they're all pretty normal.

By 3 in the afternoon, Bradford had given the Burger Island owner a few of his Springsteen CDs to play. The restaurant was empty except for This Train members. By 4 p.m., buzz about the Boss had begun. After tucking a few dollars into buckets Bradford bought for donations to the San Francisco Food Bank, each person had a story about how his or her love affair with Bruce began.

Maureen Ford and Kim Ross, both 45, of Palo Alto are partners. Maureen, Kim says, is the bigger Springsteen fan. Both are wearing shirts from different tours. The Pac Bell show would be Ford's sixth Springsteen show this year. She said it with pride; many This Train member knows the exact number of shows he or she has to and rattles off numbers such as 45 or 100 or "too many to remember" with an air of nostalgia. "It's just so worth it", Ford says. "Bruce just feeds my soul. You don't have to get it, I guess. But it's so overwhelming. His songs say something, they mean something; they touch me. I get emotional."

Bradford interjects: "Friday, I heard 'Land of Hope and Dreams' on the BART platform and I started to cry."

"It's like a religion, you just can't explain it", Ford says, returning to her veggie burger.

By 4 p.m., more of This Train has arrived. Aram Anthony comes in with his new T-shirt from Pac Bell. It reads "Sold Out" on the back. Conversations stop, people pause. He's also wearing a new hat that no one comments on. A woman skirts behind him to see what's on the back. "That's what I'm talking about!" a man shouts.

There was enough excitement over the shirt that, by 5 p.m., Ford and a woman named Marie had been to the dugout store and back. Eileen Meehan, who saw Springsteen in Ireland and was unexpectedly caught on camera with her hands clasped together as if she were praying, says, "He is simply the real thing. He gives us hope love and faith and a damn good party", she says. Her hair is a graying bob, and she's wearing a tank top announcing Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band in orange lettering. "It's like church. I get spiritually uplifted. And then I get drenched because it's also like a real rock 'n' roll party. Where else can you get that?"

On her way to see what shape the lines were in at the ballpark, Meehan had heard about a Bruce sighting. She circulated the information accordingly. "I just missed Bruce", she said, half-smiling. "He was outside signing autographs ...and I missed him." After she's mentioned this to a few people, she says, "Oh well, maybe next time."

Anthony, 42, who met Bradford on BART, has good reason to be fascinated with Bruce. "Essentially, my thoughts were being fed back to me", Anthony says.

He pauses and begins to tell a story about a concert he went to in 1990. "Bruce starts telling this story about how he used to drive past his ex- girlfriends' houses. And so he asks his therapist, 'Why?' And the therapist says, 'It's because something's broke and you're trying to fix it.' "

Anthony pushes up his glasses. "I was like, 'Hey, I do that.' But immediately after the show, the behavior stopped. It was like free therapy."

Heidi Miller, a petite Asian American woman, is playing electronic Yahtzee. Her husband, Neil, is on his cell phone. Their son, Wyatt, 10, is wearing a Springsteen T-shirt and looking at people on the street. A man says, "Neil is a true Bruce fan. His son can't afford to go to college because Neil follows Bruce around." People start chuckling and Neil smirks. "Well, that's why he gets to wear the T-shirt", he answers.

Neil Miller calls Bruce shows "transformative." He just returned from a show in Chicago.

Bradford explains a Bruce performance this way: "During the show you get transported, you sing all the words because you know them all, even though you've heard that song 20 times, it's all good. You throw your arms up in the air, and you get lost and it's great."

Heidi Miller, encourages her husband's adoration. "I think it's better, cheaper and less time-consuming than golf", she says. Hearing this, Neil Miller says he started going to Springsteen shows when tickets were just $6.50; now they're $75. And worth every penny. "You just don't see that many cross- racial, cross-gender groups anymore, or people talking about the issues."

By 5:30 p.m., concertgoers and passers-by are just looking for a burger. They have to squeeze past a group of fans near the door to get to the counter. Miller's brother, dressed in black and donning a Springsteen shirt, rallies the fans by yelling, "Bruuuce!" every time a familiar face walks in. It's an infectious rallying cry, even if it raises a few eyebrows among regular customers who have sequestered themselves to tables in the back.

"A lot of it isn't the concert itself", Bradford says. "It's the camaraderie with all of your friends, and your family."

Even before the group left and cleaned up and prepared themselves to see Springsteen, they were planning trips to his other shows. Bradford had a highlighted seating chart; people started figuring out where they'd be in relation to one another and, of course, Bruce. Bradford's son, Desmond, 8, arrived just in time for the start of the show in a blue and white Springsteen shirt.

Meehan, pausing before she left for the show, describes the Church of Bruce this way: "We go through a lot of trials and tribulations in our lives and he gives us the courage to not give up and plunge through the hard times and make hard choices."

Another fan, Eileen O'Neill, nods her head. "No fireworks, no sexy girls or psychedelic lights (at his shows)", she adds.

"And he doesn't need it", Meehan says. "That's the magic of Bruce."
