Let's face it, Bruce Springsteen has owned Boston in the past week. Five sold- out shows -- and countless memories for fans who have seen him prove it all night again. His FleetCenter engagement has been like no other. Sure, the Rolling Stones banged out two shows and created some excitement earlier this year, but they arrived under a cloud of greed and a take-the-money-and-run tone. Springsteen, on the other hand, ignited the city. "The electricity has been unbelievable", said promoter Don Law, whose company presented the band and some crew members with DVD players (with help from title sponsor Tweeter) in honor of this record-setting run in which Springsteen's group drew an overall 98,500 fans to the Fleet.

It ended last night with another maximum-strength rock party, with Springsteen and the E Street Band turning it up yet another notch.

Last shows of a long run are always special occasions -- examples being the sixth night of the Grateful Dead's annual campout at Boston Garden, the fifth that Billy Joel once played at the Worcester Centrum, and the record ninth that the band Boston played at the Centrum.

Last night was marked by a very rare performance of the poetic "N.Y.C. Serenade", with Springsteen's wife, Patti Scialfa, singing piquant harmonies.

Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, who was at the show, said Springsteen hadn't performed the song in 20 years.

A further treat was the galvanizing cameo by J. Geils Band singer Peter Wolf, who burst out during the encores to sing and dance (sometimes in a line-dance formation with a smiling Springsteen) on the dance-fevered "Raise Your Hand."

Wolf had also come out on the last night of Springsteen's Boston Garden run in 1992.

As for Springsteen, he was like a runaway express all night. During a mid-set blast through "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", he jumped on Roy Bittan's white piano, ripped off his vest (to reveal a totally sweat-drenched shirt), paused to exhort the crowd on all sides (until the volume level was deafening), then jumped down and slammed the tune to its finish.

The all-out, goodbye-to-Boston pace was set from the start with a levitating "Candy's Room" (with drummer Max Weinberg pounding his skins like an anvil), then "Ties That Bind" (which he had opened last Saturday's show with), the near-tribal "Adam Raised a Cain", and the horn-stoked "Prove It all Night"with a great call-and-response vocal joust with band mate Miami Steve Van Zandt (who, by the way, has a new album coming out soon entitled "Born Again Savage").

Springsteen went on later than usual (at 8:25), but played for three hours and blew right past the FleetCenter's 11:00 curfew. After the week he's had, let's see someone have the gall to fine him for that. Some rules are meant to be broken and this is one of them.

While Springsteen rocked well into the night, he did hush things down for what might have been the showpiece song of the set, "Pointblank", a scary, walk- the-tightrope passion story about getting in over one's head: "One false move, baby, and the lights go out", he sang, summoning genuine chills.

Most of the night, however, was sing-along catharsis: "Badlands""Jungleland", "Light of Day", an electric "Born to Run", and "Out in the Street", with saxman Clarence Clemons singing a verse to huge applause. The cool-down came later with staples "If I Should Fall Behind" and "Land of Hope and Dreams."

Springsteen waxed grateful at the end. "We just had a great time and had fantastic crowds every night", he shouted. "We just want to thank you for an incredible reception."

And then what everyone wanted to hear in hopes this E Street reunion will continue: "We'll do the best we can for you in the future."
