Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band MEN Arena, Manchester

Since he parted company with the E Street Band a decade ago, Bruce Springsteen has behaved like a mature songwriter who acknowledges his responsibilities as a liberal icon and family man. Put him on a stage, though, and anything can happen.

The Boss has always designed his performances to make some sort of point about his state of mind, so he needed to be convinced that his reunion with the E Street contingent had something fresh to say. From the opening blast of My Love Will Not Let You Down, it was clear that this was more than a show-me- the-money exercise.

The stage was cleared for action, uncluttered by props apart from a couple of flanking video screens. As families do, this one has expanded to embrace both Bruce's old buddy Steve Van Zandt and his erstwhile replacement, Nils Lofgren.

Bruce's wife Patti stood stage right.

The band attacked the music with uncomplicated force, driven by the commanding beat of drummer Max Weinberg. The material was mostly cut from the core of the Springsteen catalogue, the period bookended by Born To Run and Born In The USA.

Choice of songs, pacing and execution were impeccable. At just under three hours, this wasn't the longest Springsteen show on record, but it must have been one of the most emotionally intense.

Sometimes the songs were subtly rearranged to highlight fresh qualities. The River drifted in eerily on Clarence Clemons's sax and Springsteen's harmonica, before Danny Federici picked up the main theme on accordion. Springsteen sang Born In The USA as a solo blues, with 12-string bottleneck guitar. Darlington County was slowed down and raunched up, Bruce grinding out riffs like Keith Richards.

The band seemed to rock harder than ever, never more so than in the double punch of Murder Incorporated and Badlands. Roy Bittan's clanging piano remains their most distinctive signature, at its most affecting in a monumental reading of Backstreets.

The theme of renewal suffused the performance. During Light Of Day, Bruce testified passionately that 'if your soul has bad credit, it's good here" and promised rebirth at his 'ministry of rock 'n' roll". Deny him at your peril.

After an emotive If I Should Fall Behind, ending in the harmonies of Lofgren, Van Zandt, Clemons and Mr and Mrs Springsteen bonding around a single microphone, Bruce dedicated the new Land Of Hopes And Dreams to this E Street reincarnation. Nobody does it better. In fact nobody else can do it at all.
