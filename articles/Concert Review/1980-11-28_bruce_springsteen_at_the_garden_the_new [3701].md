Almost any Bruce Springsteen concert is triumphant, in the sense that his music celebrates ecstatic release more than any other rock musician alive and his performances are so consistently affirmative that audiences become part of that ecstasy. But his Madison Square Garden appearance Thanksgiving night was special. It was the first of four there, all long since sold out and it came at a time when , for the first time, an album of his, "The River" had reached No. 1 on the sales charts.

While Springsteen aficionados could recall other shows, especially years back in the clubs that were just as exciting as Thursday's 245 minute performance (including a 35 minute intermission) marked a new maturity. With no loss of energy, Mr Springsteen has intergrated his theatrics and lighting into the music better than ever before, and in his new songs, has purged some of his more lurid textual excesses. He was also singing better than ever and the E Street Band playing at a new level of excellence.

The set concentrated on the last three albums. The first part began with "Born To Run" and ended with "Thunder Road" and included a moving trilogy of "Darkness on the Edge of Town", "Factory" and "Independence Day". Part 2 led off with "Cadillac Ranch" as the first of five upbeat singles-orientated songs including "Hungry Heart", "Fire" and "Because The Night" and proceeded through a mostly slow group (here was the only place where pacing might be reconsidered) to the wonderful "Backstreets" and then "Rosalita". The encores were "I'm A Rocker", "Jungleland" and Mr Springsteen's Mitch Ryder medley.

There are many things that make Mr Springsteen the finest performer in rock music. Perhaps above all is the positive nature of what he conveys to his fans. Mr Springsteen is no Paul McCartney, all sunnily simplistic. But he is a far finer role model for teenagers than the petulant, bored and nasty rock stars who customarily fill the Garden. Mr Springsteen's themes may arise from the despair of working class lives. Yet his ultimate message is affirmative, a vision of the promised land right there just beyond his grasp. And the way he proposes to reach that land is through the joyous energy of rock-and-roll.

Rock started out as a slightly naughty kind of dance music but it soon became a catalyst for the transformation of Amercian popular culture. As soon as people realized its power, they began to elevate it into an art. Yet too much "art-rock" is either pretentious or not really rock at all, whatever its other virtues may be. Mr Springsteen has not entirely escaped charges of pretension and self consciousness. But the toughening of his lyrics is a sign that he is balancing himself ever more securely between that of innocent rock and its usage as art.

That useage is at one with a range of contemporary films (Martin Scorsese) of visual arts (Duane Hanson) than the lives of working people in this country as a fit subject for artistic expression. Mr Springsteen does that -and does it in an idiom -rock music-that is by now inextricably a part of people's lives.

The extent of this serves to validate the very notion of popular art, in the face of the trash continually proppgated in its name.

Years ago, Jon Landau spoke passionately if ungrammatically of Mr Springsteen as "rock and roll's future" and subsequently would realize his vision by becoming Mr Springsteen's manager and producer. While some may assume that Thursday's triumph constituted the fulfillment of that goal , others have seen Mr Springsteen as a figure from the past; at worst, maker of rock pastiche or at best, the last of a long but dying breed of rock avatars.

But it is still possible to hope that Mr Springsteen represents a future not just of rock, but of the wider reach of American culture. He has now reached No 1, but his work is still widely regarded as kids' stuff by people who might happily go and see "Raging Bull" or read Mr Terkel's "American Dreams". Seeing Mr Springsteen's effect on Thursday's audience, it is hard not to believe that he will soon make the next jump, staying true to rock's spirit but bringing its message out beyond it's current area of class, age and race and help inspire the country as a revelation of the beauty that music can provide.
