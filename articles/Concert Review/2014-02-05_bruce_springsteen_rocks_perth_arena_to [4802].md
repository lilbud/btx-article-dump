Just hours before his first show ever in Perth, Bruce Springsteen said he was determined to "keep changing things up" for his audiences and to keep on surprising them.

Coming less than a year after he last rocked arenas across Australia to critical acclaim, you could be forgiven for doubting whether he could offer any more than he had already delivered with his Wrecking Ball tour.

You could be forgiven for thinking that, but you would be so very wrong.

In a three hour and five minute show, Springsteen didn't just add a few new tracks from his latest album into an already established set list, he took the sell-out audience on a ride through his extensive work and showed them why he is able to come Down Under twice in one year and still leave you wanting more.

Starting with three tracks from Springsteen's latest album High Hopes, the E Street Band wasted no time in displaying just how tight and slick they have become after an extensive world tour.

Frankie Fell In Love and High Hopes were well received as openers, despite a slight microphone malfunction for Springsteen and Stevie Van Zandt midway through the first song.

Then cheers went up for Just Like Fire Would, Springsteen's cover of Aussie band The Saints' song that the 18-member band, including last year's stand-in for Van Zandt, Tom Morello, clearly enjoyed belting out.

But it was the tracks from some of his earliest releases that really showed the quality and experience of Springsteen and the band that took the first night of the Australia and New Zealand to a whole new level.

A fun, horns-blaring rendition of The E Street Shuffle was followed by an extensive performance of fellow second album alumni Kitty's Back.

Here Springsteen showed for anyone who still doubted, why he's known as The Boss as he conducted the five-piece horn section and carried the song over to Roy Bittan's piano for a rollicking solo, before taking on lead guitar duties over the three other famously talented lead guitarists on the stage - with a blistering solo. He even blended a little sample of Roy Orbison's Pretty Woman into the mix.

If that taste of The Wild, The Innocent and The E Street Shuffle wasn't enough to satisfy fans of his earlier work, Springsteen returned to his formative years with the only request of the night.

Taking a sign from the crowd and a cry to Bittan to "use the piano for a second", Springsteen gave the entire band a break as he took the "Professor's" seat for a slowed down version of For You - previously a faster song from his debut album.

Other show-stopping moments included the formidable guitar solos from Morello and Nils Lofgren on Ghost of Tom Joad and Because The Night, respectively.

Meanwhile the regular elements of a Springsteen show such as the young child singing a chorus of Waitin' On A Sunny Day and the female fan pulled out to join him on stage for her Courtney Cox moment during Dancing In The Dark are still carried out with that driving enthusiasm and commitment for the show-of- a-lifetime; you wouldn't think it had been done hundreds of times.

After a cover of Shout that had Perth Arena's audience jumping to an energetic party closer, Springsteen saw off the band before taking an acoustic guitar and harmonica for a solo, final and unforgettable encore performance of Thunder Road.

The Boss promised surprises to keep this tour as fresh as possible from his 2013 shows in Australia, and he definitely delivered.

If you only see two shows this year, see this one. Twice. (And then see it again.)

Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band play at the Perth Arena again on Friday and Saturday.
