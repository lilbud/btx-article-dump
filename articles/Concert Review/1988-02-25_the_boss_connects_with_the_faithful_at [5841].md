WORCESTER - 8:03 p.m. The lights dim, the Boss ruled.

With 13,000 frenzied fans crying, "Bruce, Bruce, Bruce", he stepped on the stage. The Centrum reverberated as the audience stomped its feet on the floor.

Then Bruce Springsteen, wearing black pants, white shirt and black cowboy boots, threw a bouquet of roses into the crowd and launched into the debut concert of his latest tour.

For the next three hours, Springsteen and his E Street Band kept the audience mesmerized as he covered songs from his 15-year musical career.

Springsteen is perhaps the rock star most beloved and revered by his fans. And part of the reason why could be seen and heard last night in the first of his three concerts at the Centrum.

Despite the cavernous dimensions of the arena, Springsteen was able to maintain an intimacy with his fans.

"He communicates with the audience", said Mary Burr, who came from Long Island, N.Y., to see Bruce. "He's not up there on stage like he's a big rock star and we're down here worshipping him. When he's up there it's like he's singing to me, even though the place is jammed."

Many fans said they feel that Springsteen respects his audience and gives them 100 percent effort.

"He gives you your money's worth", said Barbara McGovern, a 21-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, who paid more than $100 to attend the show. "He's just pure rock 'n' roll."

Among noteworthies in the audience were Boston Celtics star forward Kevin McHale, who towered over the rest of the crowd, and actor Rob Lowe. Both sang along with many Springsteen songs.

"Bruce is great", Lowe said. "He just goes and gives it everything he's got.

There's nothing fake about him."

Police and security personnel reported no problems with the crowd either entering or leaving the arena.

Throughout the day there were many signs about who was in town.

"No one else who comes here creates this much excitement, this much hoopla"said Linda Holstrom, who works at a clothing store in the shadows of the Centrum. "He's definitely the hottest ticket in town."

The scalpers kept one eye out for prospective customers and another eye out for police -- uniform and undercover.

Those without a ticket were debating how much they were willing to pay. "Money is no object", said Bill McKay, who drove five hours from Freehold, N.J., just for the chance to see Bruce. Springsteen was born and raised and Freehold.

"I'm willing to go about $200 but I want to get the best seat possible. He's a fellow hometown boy. Of course, I'd pay that much to see him."

About two hours before the show, scalpers were asking $150 to $250 per ticket.

The price among some ticket hawkers dropped to about $100 as the 7:30 p.m. start drew near.

Springsteen attracts one of the most loyal followings of any rock star. Fans like Steve Ticks, 28, who flew into Worcester from Los Angeles yesterday afternoon. And he did not even have a ticket.

"I'll go anywhere to see the Boss", Ticks said as he added that he has been to 147 Springsteen shows. "I've seen him in Tokyo, Ireland and all over the United States."

Ticks said he can afford to track Springsteen around the world by using his savings. "Bruce is the only thing I spend money on", said Ticks, who slightly resembles Springsteen. "And the only time I take a vacation is when Bruce tours."

Ticks said he was turned on to Springsteen when he was only 14 years old and his brother played with Springsteen at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park, N.J., one of the clubs at which Springsteen got his start. "Because I was only a kid they would let me hang around and watch Bruce. This was before he became so big."

And despite his rise to stardom, Springsteen in the eyes of his most fervent fans has not changed. His eloquent commentaries on the hopes and struggles of blue-collar and middle-class America have remained at the core of his nine albums.

Debbie Slaughter, a 33-year-old fan who recently moved to Boston from Dallas, said, "He hasn't sold out. He has remained true to his music and most importantly to himself."

Slaughter, who was about to see her third Springsteen show, said she did not become a true fan until about four years ago. "He doesn't touch people in Texas the way he does up here", she said.

"I hadn't heard much about him. I mean until just a couple of years ago, Texas was enjoying real affluence. No one was interested in listening to the things Bruce sings about. About the people who have been left out or left behind. Up here it's different."
