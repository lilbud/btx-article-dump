Talk about book-ending your show.

On Monday evening, Bruce Springsteen offered a thematically linked song cycle examining the dark heart of a dream. Throughout it, he plumbed the deepest depths of failed character, alienation and hopelessness and extolled the virtues of dreams that refuse to die.

Early in the set, Springsteen played "Reason to Believe", a song of existential despair from the mighty, near-gothic "Nebraska" record. At show's end, he offered up "Dream Baby Dream" like a haunted prayer.

It's in the seemingly vast thematic space between these two world views that the genius of Springsteen's art can be located. "Reason to Believe", a raw, primal, black-as-death folk-blues, calls forth the standard barometers of fulfillment in American life - faith, marriage, enduring love - and mocks them with a Greek chorus; "Struck me kinda funny/Funny indeed/How at the end of every hard-earned day, people find some reason to believe."

That might read as a tribute to the indomitability of the human spirit, but it isn't delivered as one; rather, it's a glance into the abyss, a bare-boned acknowledgment of existential emptiness sung through a heavily distorted harmonica microphone. Springsteen played the song passionately, his throaty delivery full of fury, rather than resignation.

"Dream Baby Dream" was offered as a hymn, a healing balm, played on the pump organ and sung with the sort of hopeful conviction Springsteen has brought to E Street Band anthems like "Land of Hope and Dreams", "No Surrender" and even "Born to Run." Life may have no inherent order or meaning, but dreams make it worth the living, the song and Springsteen's delivery suggested.

Between these pillars was a body of song often harrowing in its assessment of both the human and the American condition, occasionally hopeful and celebratory, and always taut and emotional.

Moving between a variety of guitars, acoustic piano and various keyboards, Springsteen concentrated on material from his recent semi-acoustic "Devils & Dust" record, interspersed with selections from "Nebraska" and a host of rarely-played surprises.

They bore several common characteristics: Springsteen's hybrid blues/country/r&b/folk singing, which was consistently nuanced and engaging; the taut, uncluttered harmonic arrangements of his songs; and the appearance of characters whose souls are in some kind of danger, whether from within or without.

The new songs were astounding in their live presentation.

"Devils & Dust" became a stark, cinematic nightmare in which a soldier discovers that doing his patriotic duty and preserving whatever it is that's good about him - his soul, in Springsteen lore - are mutually exclusive concepts.

"The Hitter" finds an aging boxer alienated from self, family and community collapsing in a world-weary heap on his mother's doorstep.

"Long Time Coming" is delivered in the voice of a character determined to break the Ecclesiastical chain of inherited sin by facing up to the responsibilities of fatherhood.

"Matamoras Banks" casts a searchlight on a man attempting to emigrate to the U.S. illegally via a river crossing, and dying in reverse; as the song begins, the narrator is already dead. As it progresses, he recounts the hope for a better life that brought him to the rivers edge. It's a stark, poetic slaughterhouse of a song that operates on two levels - first, as an examination of "us and them" immigration policies, and then as an unflinching meditation on the notion of death and crossing over.

Trifling pop songs these are not.

There were many surprises as well. "Empty Sky", from "The Rising", "Sandy) 4th of July Asbury Park)", "Leap Of Faith", "State Trooper", "Nebraska", "The Line", "When You're Alone", "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" - all were rarely, if ever, played on Springsteen's tour to date.

The centerpiece of Monday's show, just as it is the emotional heart of the "Devils & Dust" album, was the song "Jesus Was An Only Son", performed at the piano by a visibly emotional Springsteen. A gospel-tinged ballad with shades of both "Racing In the Street"-era E Street Band and Dylan circa "Blonde On Blonde", the song examines a mother's unconditional love for her son and has present-day implications concerning George Bush's war in Iraq.

A note to the hundreds of folks who responded negatively to my column in last week's Gusto celebrating the strength of Springsteen's solo tour, 2005\.

"Hey, dude - What'd you do on Monday night?"

My guess is you spun an E Street bootleg, circa 1974. Hope you enjoyed it.

Springsteen is one of very few modern songwriters who've successfully yearned to have it both ways; he's a star of the first magnitude, but he's also a true artist, as Monday's show made quite plain.
