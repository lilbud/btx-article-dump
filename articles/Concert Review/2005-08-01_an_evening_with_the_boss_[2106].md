The legendary Bruce Springsteen performed solo at the U.S. Bank Arena on Monday night, offering up a show filled with mixed emotions.

He was both uplifting and depressing. Dark, yearning and spiritual. And maybe just a tad self- indulgent.

A Bruce Springsteen solo show can leave many with mixed emotions. One wants to brood and muse, but also rock out. But that's why Springsteen is unique among pop performers - he can pull it all off.

Springsteen played a nearly sold out U.S. Bank Arena on Monday night configured for a large theater setting, seating some 6,000.

But this tour was a tough sell even for "The Boss."

The 55-year-old Springsteen has entertained fans the last few years by tantalizing us with a reconvened E Street Band with its sweaty rock 'n' roll.

Now he's back to solo and acoustic with a haunting new album, "Devils & Dust."

After last night's show casual fans could be heard saying, "I wish he'd rocked a little more." And the enigmatic Springsteen left even hard-core followers wondering, "What was that song?"

This was Springsteen the troubadour, playing what he wants, messing with traditional arrangements and spreading subtle moral messages with a hint of political protest.

And there was a touch of performance art, as in Springsteen's "Reason To Believe", complete with fuzzy, distorted guitars and synthesizers. Nice try Boss, but stick to the roots rock.

And that he mostly did, reinventing his songs in earthy ways.

"The Promised Land" - never been more moving and soulful.

"The Promise" - who knew it could be this poignant a ballad?

"The River" - a mournful song to begin with, and Springsteen turned it into a two-hanky tearjerker.

But the hits were few and far between.

Springsteen mostly relied on the obscure - a couple songs from his post 9/11 album "The Rising", tunes from his recent release, and perhaps more "Tunnel of Love" selections than he has been playing on this tour.

While Springsteen is rarely overtly political, he remains one of the few contemporary songwriters who can speak to the soul of American culture.

He performed "The Rising" as a noble anthem saluting the strength of America's average folks in the face of diversity.

He sang "Empty Sky" perhaps more intense than during the last full band tour.

But his "Devils & Dust" is a different album and so was his performance.

The feel of the album is almost a reflection of the desperation and depression that the country has succumbed to sensing a war has gone wrong.

He sang about the fears of the contemporary soldier on the title track in a song that eerily does for Iraqi vets what his "Born In the USA" did for the Vietnam generation - saluting the heroic troops, but expressing their frustration of being used by the politicians' rhetoric.

Springsteen was at his moralistic best when he sang about family.

His new "Jesus Was An Only Son", was performed at the piano filled with almost talking blues riffs as a sentimental reminder that it's ultimately about taking care of our own, even as the song takes some shots at the religious right.

Springsteen gave a hilarious, relatable introduction talking about his own teenage kids ("They think you are intolerable idiots") as he sang his new, wonderful "Long Time Comin.'"

Through it all Springsteen displayed his multi-instrumentalist talent, making for a much more engaging show that his last solo tour for "The Ghost of Tom Joad" when it was just the Boss and guitar.

This time he showed he can pull off piano, pump organ and remains a solid harp player.

Still this was a show for the die-hard fans, even challenging them.

He opened with the completely obscure "Two For the Road", which loyal fans in the audience had to compare notes on, deciding it was a B-side to an '80's single, never on an album.

The show was not without pretentiousness.

Springsteen came on stage asking for quiet. Latecomers were not allowed to enter the hall until after the third song.

Springsteen had to admonish the audience early on to "keep quiet if we are going to get music out of this."

Photographers, and others, were warned in advance by the publicist to "bring their quietist camera and sound baffle."

Yikes, when did rock 'n' roll turn into a church?

Of course, Springsteen is one of the few artists who can pull off a quiet, indeed spiritual, show, but still hold true to the spirit of rock 'n' roll.

No, there was no E Street Band, but the Boss was as intense as ever and ultimately showed well-written songs sung with passionate urgency don't have to be played loud
