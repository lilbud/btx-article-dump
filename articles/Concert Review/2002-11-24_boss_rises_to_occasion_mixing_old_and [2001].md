The power of Bruce Springsteen's album "The Rising" was brought home Sunday night to a crowd of 19,644 at the St. Pete Times Forum. Springsteen and the E Street Band began the show with the album's title track, its circular keyboard riff glinting like a ray of sun through the clouds. Guitarist Steven Van Zandt joined Springsteen for some heart-swelling harmonies. "Lonesome Day" was pushed to a new level by Max Weinberg's drums. They don't call him "Mighty Max" just for the alliteration. Later in the show, "Mary's Place" revealed its roots in Memphis soul. Springsteen's performance suggested the song could have been a lost Eddie Floyd number.

Springsteen set older numbers such as "The Ties That Bind" and "Night" side-by-side with his newer songs, showing the material is of a piece. Bruce went as far back as his first album, 1973's "Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.", playing such little-heard gems as "It's Hard to Be a Saint in the City" and "Does This Bus Stop at 82nd Street?" One of the show's highlights was a solo piano version of "Incident on57th Street." The passionate performance showed Springsteen hasn't lost touch with the "Spanish Johnnys" and "Puerto Rican Janes" of his early songs.

Springsteen asked for quiet, and almost got it, before singing two of the saddest songs from "The Rising": "Empty Sky" and "You're Missing." Patti Scialfa added ghostly harmonies on the former, and the emotional intensity Springsteen brought to both numbers was almost unbearable. Springsteen eased some of the tension with "Waitin' on a Sunny Day." "Badlands" and "She's the One" were as powerful as ever."Darkness on the Edge of Town" hasn't lost a bit of its strength in 24 years.

The E Street Band was, as always, amazing. Weinberg drove his band mates relentlessly. Bassist Garry Tallent provided the steady pulse. Newest member Soozie Tyrell provided extra color on the new numbers. Clarence Clemons, recently recovered from eye surgery, sounded especially fine on "She's the One." The show reached a peak with powerful performances of "Born in the U.S.A." and a rousing ""Twist and Shout."
