All hail Jay Weinberg.

Familiar name, new face. He's the teenage son of longtime E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg, and he and Dad have been sharing timekeeping duties on the current Bruce Springsteen tour, which played to a sold-out house Tuesday at the United Center.

With the younger Weinberg in the drum chair for the final two-thirds of the three-hour show, the band's chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better.

Jay Weinberg hits just as hard as his father and is a touch looser, less predictable. Reports suggest that he is working with the band as a future substitute for his father when Max Weinberg must fulfill his duties as band leader for "The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien", which debuts in June. Jay Weinberg's fills during "Radio Nowhere" kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself.

Springsteen smiled in approval. He had to love the kid's energy.

Springsteen is about as consistent as a performer gets. You pay, he plays until he drops. You may not love all the songs -- you may wish he'd play "Glory Days" or that obscure B side no one else knows except you, but Springsteen always works his tail off.

All of that was still true Tuesday, but his longtime E Street Band is in transition. It is a band of pros, and they do their jobs well, but they lack the physicality, the sustained urgency of their prime. Slowly, the band is being retooled. Stellar organist Danny Federici died last year and has been replaced by Charles Giordano. Patti Scialfa, Springsteen's wife and backing vocalist, was home in New Jersey with their three children. Violinist Soozie Tyrell, a relative newcomer, has assumed a larger role, and longtime saxophonist Clarence Clemons a smaller one, in part because he has been hobbled by ailing hips.

Springsteen has always played his band like a small orchestra, and its versatility allowed him to explore the widest contours of his catalog. He ranged from the stark blues of "Seeds" to the Celtic celebration of "American Land." The E Streeters expertly negotiated the ebb and surge of Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped" and the gospel drama of "The Rising." And they figured out the chord changes for Tommy James and the Shondells' 1968 garage-rock classic "Mony, Mony" during the audience-request portion.

"Doesn't it have some weird bridge?" Springsteen asked guitarist Steve Van Zandt. It did, and they crossed it unscathed, in one of those smile-inducing moments that echoed the band's early days, when Springsteen used to shout out impromptu covers with mischievous regularity.

If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn't make a stronger case for his latest album, "Working on a Dream." I'm not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material, which was a shame because he did a marvelous job of turning "Outlaw Pete" into a theatrical, Old West showpiece after donning a black cowboy hat, with spaghetti western guitars, Tyrell's campfire fiddle and Grand Canyon reverb on the vocals.

As usual, Springsteen divvied up the show into thematic sections. Among the strongest was the topical trinity of "Seeds", "Johnny 99" and "The Ghost of Tom Joad", a seething commentary on blue-collar citizens brought to the brink of desperation by hard times. Each was punctuated by a nasty guitar solo: Springsteen channeling the mantra of "It's gone, gone, it's all gone" on "Seeds" with a vengeance through his instrument, then Van Zandt riding hard with "Johnny 99" and Nils Lofgren spinning out from Max Weinberg's surging drums on "Joad."

The show started to settle a bit after the midway point, but Jay Weinberg took care of that problem. During "Waitin' on a Sunny Day", one of his more enthusiastic fills brought an arched eyebrow and a smile from bassist Garry Tallent. The newcomer wanted to run, and the band had no choice but to rise to the challenge.

Springsteen's show: A 6-part epic

At nearly three hours and covering 26 songs, Bruce Springsteen packed several subplots into a typically generous concert Tuesday at the sold-out United Center.

He's a master at reconfiguring his songs and sequencing them in concert to create thematic statements. Here's how he divvied up Tuesday's show:

**Part 1: Is anybody alive out there?** "Badlands", "Spirit in the Night" and "Outlaw Pete" open the show, as if to get the lay of the land, the sprawl of what is to come. They are all songs about restlessness, and Springsteen wanders into the audience several times during "Spirit" to exchange handshakes, hugs, a kiss. "Outlaw Pete" is among his most mythical creations in a songwriting career founded on mythical characters. He's so marginalized he disappears into Big Sky Country. "Can you hear me?" Springsteen wails after donning a black cowboy hat.

**Part 2: Romance** She's the One" and "Working on a Dream": Lust set to a Bo Diddley beat, then love nestles inside a big, spacious ballad.

**Part 3: Reality** "Seeds", "Johnny 99" and "The Ghost of Tom Joad" plunge the audience back into the now. Songs for citizens running short on hope and possibility in tough times, the poignancy is crowded by anger, funneled through three nasty guitar solos capping each song by Springsteen, Steve Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren.

**Part 4: Making it up as we go along** The darkness lifts for "Raise Your Hand." Then the audience-request portion of the show: A cover of Jimmy Cliff's "Trapped" and "Candy's Room" are longtime Springsteen concert staples. But next comes Tommy James and the Shondells"

1968 frat-party classic "Mony, Mony", which Springsteen says the band has never played before. They figure out the chord changes and the bridge on the fly, and make it through like a grinning garage band.

**Part 5: Give the drummer some** Teenager Jay Weinberg replaces his father, Max, on drums, and instantly kicks things into a higher gear. He finds his footing on "Waitin' on a Sunny Day" and "The Promised Land", then slams out "Radio Nowhere" with such force that the whole arena feels as if its battery has been recharged. "Lonesome Day" packs unusual punch, "The Rising" is stoked with drama, and "Born to Run" is one of those obligations that never feels like one.

**Part 5 1/2: Almost forgot the new album** Springsteen usually makes the case for his latest album on tour. Not so on this night. He performs only four songs from his recent studio release, "Working on a Dream", including "The Wrestler" and "Kingdom of Days"sandwiched inconspicuously between "The Promised Land" and "Lonesome Day."

**Part 6: Encore** Stephen Foster's 1855 plea, "Hard Times Come Again No More", receives a stark but powerful treatment with voices rising above acoustic instruments. The crowd-pleasing "Jungleland" allows Clarence Clemons to reprise his carefully composed saxophone "solo" and receive a pat on the back from the Boss. "Land of Hope and Dreams" gives way to the Celtic-flavored "American Land", inspired by Springsteen's recent exploration of the Pete Seeger songbook. "Dancing in the Dark" and the always welcome "Rosalita" close the show in high-energy style.
