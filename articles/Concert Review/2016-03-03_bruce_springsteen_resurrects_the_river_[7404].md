How can one summarize "The River", Bruce Springsteen's ambitious double album from 1980?

The Boss took a crack at it Thursday night at a packed BMO Harris Bradley Center, dubbing it his "coming-of-age record." He wanted it to be as big as life itself, so he made it about "fun, dancing, jokes, good comradeship, love, sex, faith, lonely nights and of course teardrops."

But played in its entirety in Milwaukee as part of Springsteen and the E Street Band's "The River Tour", the music from the album took on even greater meaning.

On Thursday, Springsteen tapped into the passion first put to tape 36 years ago, sprinting from song to song, often with barely a second's rest.

During "Hungry Heart", he strolled through the arena floor for handshakes and selfies, tucked a fan's sunflower behind his left ear, and lowered himself back first from an elevated catwalk, letting outstretched hands carry him back to the stage. He clustered close to his band mates around mic stands, like he was still that kid playing in those New Jersey bars, and engaged in some playful call and response with Steven Van Zandt at the end of the flirty "You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)." And near the end of roadhouse rocker "Ramrod", most of the band gathered at the lip of the stage for a bit of butt shaking.

But Springsteen, at 66, has lived a lot of life since "The River" was released. He's made a lot of good music and performed countless shows in the subsequent decades. This is not an artist who coasts on nostalgia.

So on Thursday Springsteen didn't just bring youthful energy --- brought experience and wisdom. And he made many songs from "The River" even richer.

For "Point Blank", he did so before even speaking a word. The song began with Roy Bittan's piano --- ornate yet aching --- as Max Weinberg gently tapped the drums with mallets. Springsteen meanwhile had his back to the crowd in the dim light, eyes closed, his head gently nodding, his body swaying. His face was grim as he slowly brushed the inside of his right cheek with his tongue, and he seemed to struggle as he said the words, "You wake up and you're dying/You don't even know what from."

Springsteen brought similar gravitas to the title track, complementing his weathered rasp with beautiful, borderline falsetto coos. And for "Drive All Night", his vocals and the band dropped down to a whisper; at his greatest moment of vulnerability, Weinberg's drums and Charlie Giordano's keyboards lifted him up, symbolically giving him the courage to sing, "You've got my love, you've got my love."

After the "River" material (including a spirited outtake, "Meet Me in the City", released with a deluxe "River" box set last December), Springsteen and the E Street Band played another 13 songs. And as the night went on, they became more energized.

Guitarist Nils Lofgren launched into a stormy guitar solo during "Because the Night" (first released by Patti Smith), while spinning in circles on one foot.

Saxophonist Jake Clemons captured the soul of his towering late uncle Clarence during an epic rendition of "Born to Run" finale "Jungleland." Thousands danced under the bright white house lights for "Dancing in the Dark"including one fan who danced with Springsteen on stage.

From start to finish, the concert spanned 33 songs across three-and-a-half hours.

Before wrapping up "The River" set, Springsteen spoke a few seconds more about what the album was about, offering a thesis that likely resonated with him more today than it did as a young man.

"The River", he said, was about "time slipping away.... You realize you have a limited amount of time to do your work, to raise your family, to try and do something good."

Thursday in Milwaukee, he did something great.
