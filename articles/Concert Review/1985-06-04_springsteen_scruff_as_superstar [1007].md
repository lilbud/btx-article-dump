IF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN didn't exist rock critics would have had to invent him - which, in a sense, they did. His manager, ex-journalist Jon Landau, the man who first described him as rock and roll's future, is one of the few critics who put his money where his mouth was, and Springsteen has always been a critics' cause, the clinching proof that rock could be what they claimed - humane, exciting and committed.

As Springsteen has become more successful, the meaning of his success has become more intensely debated. Interestingly, the question is not how long can a millionaire superstar go on being treated as a New Jersey scruff. Springsteen's image is so anti-glamour that, in a clever twist of the usual rock story, it's difficult to think of him as a superstar. Few commentators, for example, have noted how much money he's making from his European tour - as they certainly would for, say, the Rolling Stones.

The issue is, rather, what Springsteen's success means politically. In the right corner, Ronald Reagan, who last year claimed that the Born in the USA Springsteen was an example of what he wanted for Americans. In the left corner, Dave Marsh, Springsteen's biographer and publisher of the influential American newsletter Rock'n'Roll Confidential, which assiduously documents Springsteen's support of trade unions and places him in the collectivist tradition of American populism.

From the latter perspective, Springsteen's importance rests not so much on his songs of blue-collar plights and pleasures but on his performing ability to summon up solidarity - his live shows have always been the core of the Springsteen myth. The question that's currently being debated then, is whether Springsteen's ability to enter his fans' lives can survive his commercially necessary move into stadia and football fields.

On the evidence of his opening night in Newcastle on Tuesday, I'd say yes and no - Springsteen can humanize an open-air crowd better than any other rock performer I've seen, but he couldn't completely surmount the distance and discomfort. This clearly worried him. Springsteen needs to feel his audience's response and in Newcastle he worked very hard to get it, eschewing (thanks goodness) the alienating device of blowing-up video screens, throwing his phenomenal energy into every trick he's ever learnt about crowd control.

Maybe because he was having to work so hard for it, though, the secret of Springsteen's success became a more intriguing question at Newcastle than ever. Why is this buoyant little man with his overflowing stock of familiar rock phrases so engaging?

Part of the answer lies in his band, whose subtlety, timing and attack is so immaculate as to be taken for granted - only Nils Lofgren's over-shrill guitar solos sounded an occasional false note. The E-Street Band aren't a youth group, but a great house band, effortlessly underscoring every Springsteen point.

And this may be Springsteen's real secret - he's best thought of as a brilliant playwright, a dramatic storyteller who's most convincing invention is himself - the decent, dissatisfied, romantic worker (who, on stage, is always set off by the visual star of the show, Clarence Clemons, resplendent in pink and white suits). Springsteen's introductions to his songs, drawing on his teenage myths and memories, the theatrical structure of his melodies, build up the portrait of a man who is honest about both his vulnerability and his strengths. He struts the stage like a bantam cock, looking for a fight then charming his way out of it. He's a hero whose model of masculinity seems to be based less on James Dean, the usual source of male rock romance, than on James Cagney.

Springsteen's real gift is his ability to pull his audience into his world, rather than, like most rock stars, displaying it to us as a spectacle. He can do this because he is a great singer - in the end, it's the shape and sound of his voice that convince us he's the character he says he is. The high points of the Newcastle show weren't the rockers - they fragmented in the evening air as too-familiar stadium sounds - but the brooding songs, 'The River', 'My Hometown', 'Racing in the Streets', Springsteen's voice cupping their regrets.

As he finished his final encore, Springsteen wailed in imitation of James Brown: "I'm just a prisoner, I'm just a prisoner, I'm just a prisoner... of rock and roll!" James Brown himself was over here the weekend before with a show that, uncannily, suggested what Springsteen might mean. Brown, one of the greatest stage performers ever, comes across these days as a tourist attraction. And while he acted out the James Brown myth, his audience acted out the myth of the James Brown audience.

This is the danger that Bruce Springsteen, rock and roll's last, mythical superstar now faces.
