Concert Review at the Music Hall, Boston, March 23, 1977

As the rains pelted Bolyston Street inside the Music Hall, the Wunderkid of Rock, Bruce Springsteen was recreating tableux of sun bleached Jersey streets, souped up Chevies and prurient adolescence.

He was conducting his own symphony of the sidewalk with angry thrusts and sensual sideswipes as a capacity crowd of 4200 showed their appreciation. It was a genuine moment in rock when realization met the anticipation and Springsteen proved that he was no creature of hype.

During a two hour non stop performance, the pinball wizard of Asbury Park lit up the stage with a dazzling light show of dynamic pyrotechnics . He roamed the bandstand like a frantic stallion and played the audience like a finely tuned harp.

The lyrical clout of the songs was conspicuous. The restlessness of youth, its feeling of isolation and the urban lowlife encapsulating those feelings made for easy rapport with the listeners.

In truth, there is a contextual sameness to much of Springsteen's writings.

How many different ways does one describe the eternal zooming down a two lane highway for a night on the town and the yen to snap the fetters of parental discipline ?

Springsteen, based on his three album output, does become somewhat repetitious but his total performance revealing him as probably rock's most complete entertainer, considerably mitigates this sin.

Some have said his lyrics are susceptible to several interpretations. Maybe, but their essence is as conspicuous as the unrelenting zeal with which he attacks each of his songs.

While not a concept program, the content in its way comprised a curbside cantata with Springsteen feverishly assaulting the consciousness with an intensity that continued to swell finally erupting in the bombast frenzy of Rosalita. There was the potent imagery of Thunder Road in which the Sal Mineo like rebel cajoled his girl to escape to Backstreets smouldering in youthful frustration and loneliness and Born to Run a percussive drag race in which the audience members went along for the wild ride.

Squatting in front of the stage and with only backlighting to create a Wyeth starkness, Springsteen rasped out a recitation of Jungleland. Earlier, he had burlesqued a Simian pose during Tenth Avenue Freezeout, and introduce a frolicy composition, yet unnamed, with a bolero opening crisp choreography and a vocal urgency of a Van Morrison.

Thunder Roads was as delightful as any with its Bo Didley hand jive supplanted by Max Weinberg's muscular drum accents. Spirit in the Night had the band loping and Springsteen leaping into the audience area. Returning on stage, he dredged up a James Brown bit by supplicatingly clutching the left leg of saxophonist Clarence Clemons.

The E Street Band also included Roy Bittan on piano, Danny Frederici organ, , Garry Tallent playing bass and Steve Van Zandt guitar. The augmenting Miami Horns numbered Ed De Palma baritone saxophone, Denis Orlock trombone and John Benkley and Steve Parezcky trumpets.

One standee was heard to give the following on the spot evaluation: "He's the best".

Whether this is the consensus of Bruce Springsteen's talent is a moot question. He is most assuredly as refreshing as zephyr in the desert and a welcome messenger seemingly offering deliverance of the dross afflicting too much of rock. Springsteen has now arrived at the elite plateau where Joe Cocker could have been.

The pinball champ from Asbury Park took his shots and lit up the board last night.
