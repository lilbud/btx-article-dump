For rock fans, a trip to the Hard Rock Calling festival on the same weekend The Rolling Stones were playing at Glastonbury might have seemed like a consolation prize. But, as it turned out, what they really got with Sunday night's headliner, Bruce Springsteen, was a Willy Wonka golden ticket.

If this was an attempt to rewrite the history of Springsteen's London gig last summer, when fans braved ankle-deep mud in Hyde Park only to see his duet with Paul McCartney cut off mid-encore, then it succeeded. The setting, a pop-up venue on the site of the old Olympic basketball arena, wedged between empty blocks of athletes' flats and the Pringle-shaped curve of the Velodrome, couldn't have been more different from the royal park. The hard, concrete floor may have been carpeted with artificial grass, but it was difficult to disguise the fact that this was a gig being held on a building site. Yet with all those solid surfaces, and speakers cranked up to top volume, the sound, finally, was perfect and, as if in collusion, the sun stretched out above to create an almost perfect setting.

Support band, the Black Crowes, responded in kind with a short yet sweet set of pure Muscle Shoals soul rock. Mocked as anachronistic rock revivalists when they emerged during the grunge boom of the early Nineties, their commitment to midcentury southern grooves now makes them seem like retro-pioneers. Mick Jagger may have thanked Otis Redding but it was lead singer Chris Robinson, looking like he was wearing the same shirt and flared jeans he wore the last time I saw him nearly twenty years ago, who really conjured up the legend's sprit in his still blistering cover of Hard to Handle.

Springsteen's take on rock was no less joyful, celebratory and, to my surprise, funky. When you know someone is going to deliver a three hour set, it comes as a bit of shock when they come out all guns blazing. As the E Street Band tore through Badlands, Prove it All Night and Johnny 99 I wondered how on earth they were going to keep this up, but also how on earth I was going to keep this up, dancing on this unforgiving AstroTurf without my back or knees giving way? But Springsteen goads and shames you on with his own stunning filibuster of a show. Never have I seen a rock star's face so burnished with bliss at the joy of performing and his band partied around him like they were having their own New Orleans's carnival.

But the real shock and joy came when Springsteen announced he was going to play the whole of his landmark Eighties album Born in the USA. For old fans and the large contingent of twenty and thirtysomething newcomers, this was as good as it got. A magical hour went by as the 65-year-old used the brilliance of his band and his weathered voice to find new depths in those classic songs.

He topped it off by bringing out his mum to serenade her during Dancing in the Dark, in place of Courtney Cox, followed by his little sister. It felt like the Olympic Park was still a place where magic exists.
