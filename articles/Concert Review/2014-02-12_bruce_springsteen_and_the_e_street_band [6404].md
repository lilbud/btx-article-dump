ON Wednesday night, I tossed a few dollars into The E Street Band Jukebox, made 12,000 people dance and broke the keyboard of Professor Roy Bittan via the feet of Bruce Springsteen.

It's mid-encore, just after Born To Run, the house lights are up and the Adelaide Entertainment Centre is rocking on the second of two nights for The Church of Bruce in the city of churches.

Where to next?

I grab my homemade sign from between my sweaty knees where it has been nestled for the past 2.5 hours.

It was made just after a breakfast that morning, with a $3.25 black texta and a free used cardboard box from Boost Juice in the Rundle Mall after buying a mango magic smoothie.

On one side of the sign I scrawled "Reason To Believe" from Springsteen's 1982 Nebraska solo record to be worked up into the bluesy, full-band swagger it is played with these days.

On the other side, I wrote the Eddie Floyd cover"Raise Your Hand", which the E Street Band made their own as a show-stopping party song and released in 1986 on Live 75/85.

One needs options, depending on the mood.

There can only be one choice at this time, however. "Raise Your Hand" it is.

We need a call to the dance floor.

The sign is now above my head --- I'm in the third row in the pit in front of Springsteen and guitarist Steve Van Zandt --- when the strangest thing happens.

The Boss looks at me and his eyes light up. We have eye contact. We're in.

I will have to check the bootleg but he may have even said "OK, buddy" or something similar. Maybe I imagined that.

There is someone off to my right, very excited, jumping up and down, waving their arms around crazily, who thinks their sign has got up, but I don't have the heart to break it to them.

Bruce walks down to the front of the stage to me, takes my sign and takes it back and puts it at the base of his mic stand as is tradition with audience requests.

Everything from now on is a bit of a blur. One also becomes very selfconscious.

Is my handwriting OK? Would my mother and father, both teachers, be proud of the shape of that letter A?

Why didn't he take my "Summertime Blues --- 41 degrees" sign the night before --- they beat me to it and opened with it --- when I'd spaced out the letters so evenly?

Does The Boss realise that the sign he is holding has been wedged between my sweaty legs all night on this 42-degree day?

Bruce yells out "Stevie!!" or something similar --- I don't think it was "Miami Steve!!!" like on the live album but I'll forgive him --- and Van Zandt hits that lick. The E Street Band join him.

The crowd are up. Bruce is up, too, on top of the piano. He is dancing on Roy's piano at my whim. Holy smokes.

That's when trouble strikes: Bruce is too excited, stumbles on to Roy's adjacent keyboard and breaks it.

"I broke Roy's keyboard", Bruce tells the crowd, laughing.

There doesn't seem to be any keys in the sound mix at all now. Bruce pauses as the song limps along for a few bars.

It sounds like my request is all over, 60 seconds in. This is not what I envisioned. I kind of want to hide.

Not to worry. This is the legendary E Street Band.

The Professor is suddenly heard again --- maybe he just stopped playing the piano in shock or has now swapped instruments --- and the song roars back to life.

Bruce does a lap of the arena through the crowd. By now, it feels like everyone in the pit has high-fived me.

Whatever they played would have got a great response, of course.

But there is something magical about watching Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band --- recently named the greatest live act on the planet by Rolling Stone --- play your song live, without notice, on the spot, and get the whole house bouncing to it.

Springsteen has never needed encouragement to mix up his shows, though the "stump the band" sign requests have become a tradition up to several times at each show in recent years.

During last year's 10 Australian shows the band played 79 different songs.

This year, after the first five shows in Perth and Adelaide, they have already hit that mark.

I attended all last year's shows and have seen him play great runs in Europe and the US in recent years --- Hyde Park with Sir Paul McCartney and Paris on Independence Day --- but this Australian tour so far has been more varied than any.

Some fans believe the recent decision to release live downloads of each gig is driving Springsteen to overhaul his set lists even more than normal each night.

NJ.com blogger Stan Goldstein, a longtime New Jersey fan who reports on each show around the world, wrote after the Adelaide double-header of Springsteen's "hot streak" in Australia.

"Bruce is mixing up the set list like a mad scientist", he wrote.

Where to next?

The initial reaction is to try and find a YouTube clip to relive that song on Wednesday night.

Then again, maybe it is better to keep it as a memory, a moment in time, never to be relived again.

I just hope "The University of Musical Perversity" doesn't bill me for the keyboard.

Sorry, Professor. But I blame The Boss.
