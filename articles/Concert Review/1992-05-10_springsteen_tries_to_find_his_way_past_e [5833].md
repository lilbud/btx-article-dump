Longtime Bruce Springsteen fans must have been in shock. It's one thing to hear Springsteen without the E Street Band, but quite another to see him without them, which happened on "Saturday Night Live" this weekend. It was Springsteen's first live TV appearance, but it achieved mixed results.

The main reason Springsteen booked the show, contrary to reports about his declining record sales needing a boost, was to prove to fans that he could cut it without his veteran E Street Band, which he's broken up. The key question is: Did this three-song cameo with his new band (which we're now told will be the core of his road group) help sell tickets for his yet-to-be-announced tour?

Yes ...and no. Springsteen has gone to a guitar-heavy lineup that sounded like a rough 'n' ragged garage band on "SNL", but lacked the versatility and group dynamic of the E Street Band. The new group -- much younger than Springsteen -- consists of guitarist Shane Fontayne (formerly of Lone Justice); drummer Zachary Alford (who has toured with the B-52's); bassist Tommy Simms (little is known except he's from Tennessee); and keyboardist Roy Bittan, an E Street holdover, though he played a minimal role Saturday.

Springsteen's choice of so many relative unknowns suggests a a complete starting over. "I felt like I'd gone a long time playing with the same people.

...There's a responsibility to step out a bit", he told MTV's Kurt Loder.

And that seemed to be his theme Saturday. The new unit careened through "Luckytown", with Springsteen shouting an over-the-top vocal much harsher than the recorded version. They added a bizarre, avant-garde treatment of "57 Channels" (a wry tune about cable TV), followed by their best performance on "Living Proof", a jolting rocker about Springsteen's joy at his son's birth.

Of the three, only "Living Proof" was convincing. Otherwise, this was very much a work-in-progress. Give Springsteen credit for taking risks, but don't be surprised if fans miss the E Street Band.
