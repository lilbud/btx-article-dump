Reviewing a Bruce Springsteen concert is like reviewing Father Christmas.

The Boss and Santa have very different gigs, but they never put on a bad show and, in the end, you always feel like you've been given a gift -- even if you're the one paying for it in the form of a $130 ticket.

On his off nights, Springsteen is better than most other performers at the top of their game. When he's on ... well, there's just nothing that can compare.

On Sunday night at Copps Coliseum in front of a near-sellout crowd of almost 18,000 loyal fans, The Boss was on.

At 63, Springsteen may not be moving with the same fireball energy with which he started more than 40 years ago, but the vitality remains, and that raspy voice of his seems to be getting better - maybe it's because of the incredible clarity of the sound system and maybe some things just improve with age.

He started out late, hitting the stage for a scheduled 7:30 p.m. concert at 8:25 p.m., but he made up for it by opening, almost apologetically, with a personalized greeting: "Hello Hamilton, it's Hammertime", and then tore into My Love Will Not Let You Down.

He was anxious to meet the crowd and on his second number, Out In The Street, he stepped off the stage and into the crowd, rubbing flesh, passing his microphone to young children, reaching over the boards to touch, hug and shake hands.

By the third song the audience was in full sing-a-long with Hungry Heart, with Springsteen pushing his way onto a second stage in the middle of the rink, trusting his fans enough to fall backwards on to their waiting arms and then crowd-surfing his way a full fifty feet back to the main stage.

Not bad for an old man. And there were still some two and a half hours and some 25 more songs left in a show that didn't end till almost 11:30 p.m. --- three full hours without a break.

The show was slick and sentimental, at times a little cheesy (how does he manage to find so many little girls who know the lyrics to Waiting On A Sunny Day?), but most of all it was passionate, even inspired.

This is the first tour Springsteen and his E Street Band has toured without the towering presence of the Big Man, Clarence Clemons on saxophone, who died last year. There were plenty of teary moments marking Clemons' passing, especially during the closing encore of Tenth Avenue Freeze Out which include a special video tribute.

Musically, Springsteen made up for the loss with a special expanded edition of The E Street Band, with a five-piece horn section and a four backing singers and percussionists. All told, there were 17 players on stage (Patti Scialfa sent her regrets), adding a depth to the music that took on revival-tent proportions during a spectacular gospel-tinged Spirit In The Night.

He picked his set list from every part of his 40-year career, including Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street (from his first album, Greetings From Asbury Park), The Rising, She's The One, Born To Run, Because The Night, Badlands, Rosalita, Dancing In The Dark and Land of Hope And Dreams.

As well, the band performed several songs from the newest album Wrecking Ball, including the title song, Shackled And Drawn, We Take Care Of Our Own, Jack Of All Trades and Death To My Hometown.

There was also the now-familiar request segments, where Springsteen wades out into the crowd and picks colourful "song signs" from crowd members - we got I'm Going Down (for a fan who confided that he had just been "dumped" by his girlfriend) and a rare solo acoustic performance of Terry's Song, a "hidden track" from Springsteen's Magic. It closes the album, but isn't listed on the album cover.

Whether it was on the set list or prompted by a sign from the crowd isn't clear. But it was requested in honour of Sydney Wood, an 11-year-old girl who died suddenly in August.

Terry's Song was a special moment, with Springsteen telling the audience how he wrote it in honour of a long-time friend (Terry Magovern) who worked as Springsteen's personal assistant for 23 years before dying in 2007.

It was a sad story that Springsteen told, but still it was filled with laughs about the good old days playing the New Jersey bar circuit. Terry's Song got a huge ovation. For true Springsteen fans, it was just like a gift found under the tree.
