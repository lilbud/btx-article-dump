Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band came to the United Center on Sunday promising to give only the second public performance of the "Born to Run"

album. They delivered and then some in a concert that had twice the energy of their performance at the same venue in May.

The 1975 album has held up well -- six of its eight songs are in regular rotation at Springsteen concerts, and I've yet to see one of his shows where the title track hasn't been a highlight. But there was an undeniable, cumulative power in seeing the album performed in sequence, its arch of youthful possibility traced from the promise of "Thunder Road" to the desperate rituals of "Jungleland."

Springsteen, who turns 60 on Wednesday, was not pacing himself. He had no stories to tell, no shtick to indulge, no time to waste. He slammed songs together like bumper cars, barely pausing for breath and changing guitars on the fly as he played it hard and fast for nearly three hours. He made sure the E Streeters followed suit.

They looked tired the last time they were in town, with a cameo appearance by Max Weinberg's son Jay making much of an impression. But this time, Springsteen put the band, which expanded to as many as 11 pieces for some songs, through its paces with James Brown-like rigor. He laughingly chided the band for messing up "Working on a Dream", then later acknowledged that he missed a verse. He urged on solos and orchestrated the interplay, part cheerleader, part taskmaster.

The band responded with an inspired performance, in particular Clarence Clemons, who appeared to be sinking into the shadows in May. This time, he was engaged from the get-go, even discarding his fedora to beam a few smiles in between sax solos. The rhythm section had a great night. Garry Tallent's bass boomed out a clarion call to dance, and Max Weinberg channeled '60s session great Hal Blaine on a powerhouse cover of The Ronettes' "Da Do Ron Ron."

Though the "Born to Run" songs are part of any Springsteen fan's DNA by now, the familiarity hardly diminished the impact -- particularly when the band swung into the album's formidable midsection: "Backstreets", "Born to Run" and "She's the One", complete with Yardbirds-style rave-up.

With its dramatic introductions and ebb-and-flow arrangements, the album served as a fine showcase for the orchestral possibilities of the band, notably Weinberg's timpani-style drumming and the keyboard interplay of Roy Bittan and Charles Giordano. Particularly effective was "Meeting Across the River", one of the few mood pieces of the night, with Curt Ramm's lonely trumpet and Richard Davis' upright bass spearheading a smoky, cabaret quartet treatment.

There was a danger that everything after "Born to Run" would be anticlimactic, and, frankly, some of it was. But Springsteen wouldn't allow any letup. He closed the main set with a roaring "Badlands", and the seven-song encore was performed with house lights up. There have been times when "Rosalita" closed shows out of obligation. On this night, it was a deserved celebration.
