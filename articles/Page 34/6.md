Bruce Springsteen lived here, and played the local bars. Ed Vulliamy goes in search of the Boss's spiritual home

Even without Bruce Springsteen, Asbury Park has history. Long before Springsteen named his first album after the place and took its mythology as his own, it was a blue-collar holiday Mecca. Billie Holiday performed here. So did Sinatra, the Marx Brothers, The Who, the Rolling Stones. The beer joints were packed. On a summer Saturday, there was barely anywhere to sit on the beach.

Now, Asbury Park, on the New Jersey coast line, is Ghost-Town-sur-Mer. Take the casino: a fine 1920s iron-and-glass edifice where Bill Haley used to play.

Only 10 years ago, Springsteen purists were worried about plans to turn this treasure into a Hard Rock Caf√© and state-of-the-art recording studio. They needn't have worried. It's now bolted shut.

Take the 'Palace Amusements' arcade, until recently home to the Asbury Park Rock and Roll Museum, the walls of which were lined with Springsteen memorabilia: the psychedelic sign from the Upstage club where he first played; rare photos of his old band, Steel Mill. Now the sign made famous on Springsteen's videos of the Palace arcade reads only 'PA A E AMUS EN', though you can still just about make out 'Tunnel of Love' (it was an album and song title - the video was shot here). The Park Cinema ('PAR CINE A') is still open, showing 'adult matinees', with a man at the door who wears a toupee and looks like a character from Nightmare on Elm Street. I try to start a conversation. 'You wanna see the girl-show or stay out?' is all he will say.

The story of the decline of Asbury Park is also the story of the death of the kind of blue-collar America about which Springsteen has always written. At the close of the Sixties, when Springsteen started playing, the Jersey Shore had its own anti-heroic, all-American identity, which spawned a humming rock'n'roll scene. You could call it Liverpool's cousin - it had all the same hallmarks: a seafaring tradition, a history more lambent than its present, high unemployment, the ridicule of the metropolitan elites - and a fierce urban pride.

Lennon and McCartney had Penny Lane and the Magical Mystery Tour; Springsteen had Asbury Park's Broadwalk and the Backstreets. Springsteen arrived in Asbury Park during 1967, the summer of love. 'This was no idyllic Big Sur landscape', remarks Springsteen's biographer David Marsh, 'but for anyone with a taste for tackiness, for connoisseurs of junk-food America, Asbury Park scored as paradise."

The Upstage Club was the magnet for 'shoreside musicians', with two sessions a week - one running from eight till midnight, and a second from one till five in the morning. Writing the notes to a debut album by Southside Johnny (one of the shore gang), Springsteen described what the Upstage was all about: 'Everybody went, because between one and five in the morning you could play pretty much whatever you wanted and if you were good enough you could choose the guys you wanted to play with."

Springsteen was good enough. 'It was a great place', he continues, 'you could work it so you'd never go home... by the time you got out of there it was dawn and you could just flop on the beach all day, or you could run home before it got too light, nail the blankets over the windows and sleep straight through till the night."

The Upstage is now home to OK Shoes, run by Mr Chang. Mr Chang has never heard Bruce Springsteen's music. He declines a guided tour. 'You want to buy it?' he asks. Calvin Morris is buying basketball shoes at OK. He was never much of a Springsteen fan, but he remembers the days, and misses them. 'It was cool. The place was full of people. The chicks were loose, you know? This guy [Springsteen] did a lot of good for this town. He put this town on the map - but really we was off the map already. The bad stuff had started while he was already here... It's never been as bad as it is now - never'. Calvin lost his job at the local telephone company two years ago. The basketball shoes he wants are too expensive.

Things started to go wrong here in 1970, when the shadow of the Watts riots moved over Asbury Park. Whole quarters of Asbury Park burned to the ground, including the downtown shopping district. Steve Van Zandt, guitarist in Springsteen's embryonic E Street Band, said later that the Upstage scene 'went right down with it'. The band was reduced to playing for a dollar a set. In 1971, with Asbury Park's reputation in shreds, the Upstage closed. Van Zandt got a job building roads.

Springsteen went off to Greenwich Village to play solo with his acoustic guitar. There he met John Hammond, who had signed and produced Billie Holiday, Bessie Smith, Aretha Franklin and the man known as his 'folly', Bob Dylan. And now, at the behest of Springsteen's agent Mike Appel, he sat listening to a scrawny guy from the Jersey Coast singing 'It's Hard To Be a Saint In the City'. Hammond thought he was signing a folk act; instead he got a gale-force band which recorded Greetings From Asbury Park in three weeks. Then came The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle and then Born To Run. But Springsteen kept a foothold in Asbury Park.

It's a barely noted irony, though, that almost all of Springsteen's songs about Asbury Park are founded on the characters' desperate desire to leave. On 'Sandy (Asbury Park, Fourth of July)', the singer expresses his fear that he could get stuck on an ever-spinning fairground ride. Three years later, on 'Thunder Road', he declares baldly: 'It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win'. While Springsteen's songs may romanticise the Shore, they are really about trying to escape it. It's hardly surprising that Springsteen himself eventually flew the nest.

In the summer of 1974, a new club opened up - the Stone Pony - looking for a band who would draw crowds on a regular basis. That band, made up of Springsteen's entourage, came to be called the Asbury Jukes, led by 'Southside' Johnny Lyon, and hosted, whenever he came off the road, by The Boss himself.

The Stone Pony came to be known as The House That Bruce Built. During one winter stretch in the early Eighties, he played there virtually every Sunday.

It was from here that the Born in the USA tour was launched into the world's stadiums. Its finest hour arrived on 26 September 1992, when Asbury's four most famous sons - Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Van Zandt and Southside Johnny - played together on stage for the only time. Less than a week later, the Stone Pony was declared, as its manager Lee Mrowicki, said, 'stone broke'. Now, the stage in the locked building is dark and lifeless. The walls of the club are peeling. The 'We Are Open' sign reads 'AR OPE'.

Asbury Park is caught at a confluence of difficulties. Better incomes for more people meant that more people could take holidays beside the turquoise ocean in Florida, rather than on Jersey's chilly, polluted shore. The gambling and casino business lost out to heavyweight developments in Atlantic City. First, the white middle class began to leave. Then the black middle class followed them. Crime boomed. It is the same story told all over small-town industrial America.

There was a plan a decade ago to build a row of vast sea-front condominiums called Ocean Mile, selling at around $135,000 each. The sepulchral edifices of this plan, abandoned halfway through construction in 1992 when the developer went bust, now loom over the ghosts of the Broadwalk. 'The only people who got rich were the lawyers', says Rita Marano, owner of the Kingsley Avenue Deli.

Some 20 per cent of Asbury Park's population now receives some kind of state assistance. Unemployment runs at 18 per cent, in contrast to five per cent across the county. But a few people clung on. Big Danny Gallagher was one of the pivotal figures on the Jersey Shore scene, an Irish-Amercian who was Springsteen's room-mate 'from 10 August 1972 until the end of summer 1973', later his road manager. Gallagher stayed on The Shore long after Springsteen had left, but eventually he too departed for his native Dublin. He wrote a song about the decline of Asbury Park - 'Summertime in My Hometown', and now has this to say: 'Before I left Asbury Park I had big thick curtains, because I didn't want to look out of the window. I'd hear gunshots late at night. My landlord's car had bullet holes in the headrest from two idiots who were shooting up the front lawn. I started thinking: "How long am I going to be on the planet? This is where I live. Beirut, New Jersey."

Still, there was only one place, really, that Springsteen and the reunited E Street Band could choose to launch the tour which rolls into London this week.

The concert in Asbury Park happened on 19 March. People with tickets they had bought for $20 were turning down offers of $1,000.

Two Congressmen asked for special consideration, and were denied. The $100,000 proceeds went to four local charities. Springsteen played for nearly three hours without an interval. 'I don't know what to say', said Springsteen from the stage, 'except that I'm really happy."

When Springsteen had gone, I talked to a long-term resident of Asbury Park, Anthony Wreiole, who sat staring out to sea, surrounded by vases, paintings, gun holsters and 1940s Coke bottles in wooden crates. 'Big cities survive', he told me, 'because they are big cities. They have to. But Asbury Park doesn't have to. Places like this become a parable for the rest of America. What happened here will happen everywhere else sooner or later. There may be room for a revival. But it ain't going to happen any time soon."
