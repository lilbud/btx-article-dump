In his own words, there's a lot more to the story of The Boss than cars and girls.

In 1973, touring to support Bruce Springsteen's debut album, each E Street Band member took a turn driving 'Mad Dog' Vini Lopez's wagon - everyone except The Boss. "My style behind the wheel was considered inept and reckless endangerment." One of the more ironic truths revealed in this superb memoir is that America's automotive poet laureate was such a lousy driver he didn't hold a licence until his mid twenties. So much for "racing in the streets". As the author himself admits: "I know I'm good but I'm also a poser... 'Authenticity' would be what you made of it, a hall of mirrors. Put on the work shirt, young man. No big deal."

Work, of course, is the quality that defines Bruce Springsteen. It's through sheer effort that he became so good at the other stuff - songwriting and performing. During his pre-fame scrabbles he got tagged 'the new Dylan', but Springsteen himself knew better. At the end of a hair-raisingly entertaining account of his early band Steel Mill's unsuccessful 1970 trip to California, a realisation dawned: "I was not a natural genius. I would have to use every ounce of what was in me... to push myself harder, to work with more intensity than the next guy just to survive."

At 500 unghosted pages, his autobiography is just another example of this maniacal commitment. Born To Run reads how the perfect Springsteen show or album might flow: meticulous existential analysis and ripping yarns, grit mixed with cheese. Aside from a brief initial showiness, his prose is lyrical yet pointed, at its best resembling a gentler Nelson Algren, all seasoned with humour (often surprisingly ribald).

We realise his rigour is a by-product of psychotherapy for depression, which began in late 1982 following what reads like a breakdown. Springsteen acknowledges he could barely function beyond the stage or the studio.

Confessing to briefly enjoying "the sexual perks of superstardom" circa Born In The USA, this "generally serial monogamist" was incapable of sustaining a relationship beyond three years. His first marriage, to actress Julianne Phillips, crashed just short of that buffer ("I was still emotionally stunted").

Thanks to a deeply evocative portrayal of his early years, the diagnosis is clear: the family home in working-class Freehold, New Jersey was a psychic warzone between ebullient mother Adele and misanthropic father Doug, whose mental illness profoundly haunted Bruce. These conflicting influences rendered him "a conceptual optimist yet a personal pessimist". His salvation was Patti Scialfa, the Jersey girl who gave as good as she got, then parenthood - yet for all the personal and material nourishment he enjoys today, the black dog still bites. He's taken antidepressants for the past 15 years; his sixties have been "a rough, rough ride".

Named after the song which first detonated him into mass consciousness, this is hard-wrought, beautifully delivered testimony to the realisation its author had upon that initial burst of celebrity: running is all very well, but you need to have somewhere to go. That's when the hard graft starts, and perhaps never really stops if you're Bruce Springsteen, still a work in progress, still tougher than the rest.
