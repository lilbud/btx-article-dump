- 2025-04-09: added missing Max Weinberg article
  This is a transcript of a lecture/Q+A that Max gave at London's Astoria Theatre in August of 1986. The link that was on the thread led to a 404. But after getting in touch with Dan French regarding something else, he sent over a folder and this was in it. I ran OCR on the PDF and extracted the text. Some errors likely remain.
