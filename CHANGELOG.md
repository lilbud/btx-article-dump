- 2025-03-22: Initial Release
  978 articles included
  All were copied from the BTX article thread using web scraping and other python libraries

- 2025-04-09: added missing Max Weinberg article
  This is a transcript of a lecture/Q+A that Max gave at London's Astoria Theatre in August of 1986. The link that was on the thread led to a 404. But after getting in touch with Dan French regarding something else, he sent over a folder and this was in it. I ran OCR on the PDF and extracted the text. Some errors likely remain.

- 2025-06-20: added missing Mojo Magazine interview
  This interview was done by Keith Cameron in August 2010. Discussing topics like the upcoming Hyde Park DVD and the Darkness box. It was originally posted on the BTX Article Thread (Page 27), but was done so as pictures of the magazine. Those were hosted elsewhere, and the links were incomplete. I tried to track down a scan of the magazine, but came up short back in March when I was working on this. I reached out to Eddie, who I worked with on the Backstreets Magazine archive project. He checked around, and received a scan from Essexboy.

  I received the scan as JPG, merged into a PDF. And fed those through an OCR process. Some errors might remain but I fixed what I could.
