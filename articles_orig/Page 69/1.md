"..As time went on, president carter wasn't the only celebrity dying to meet me. The biggest rock-and-roll star since Elvis had busted out, and my son, Larry, was dying to see him. I pulled some strings and we were off to see Bruce Springsteen.

Since I'm a Vegas kind of guy, I didn't have any background in big-time rock shows. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know we needed 14 badges and 18 wristbands to get past the 32 security guards to get to our seats in the VIP area. I didn't know that the 20 loudspeakers onstage would be blasting out more noise than atomic bombs. I didn't know that the show would go on for 3 hours, getting louder by the minute.

Didn't know that his fans sitting around us would be screaming even before the show started.

When we were finally escorted in, I saw this extremely kind and sweet man wearing a bandana around his forehead. He looked like a pirate.

"Great show, Bruce", I said.

"Hope you'll come to another one" he said.

"What?" I said. "I can't hear you."

I'd gone deaf.........

In spite of the volume, I really liked the Springsteen show. I could see why his fans were so loyal. But of course loyalty for me always back to Sinatra."
