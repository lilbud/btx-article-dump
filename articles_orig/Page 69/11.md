To the Editor:

Bruce Springsteen as the voice of the average American? Maybe once.

One of Mr. Springsteen's best qualities was his apolitical stance. But his work has more and more become politically correct liberal boilerplate. From "Streets of Philadelphia" to his odes to illegal immigrants on "Ghost of Tom Joad" to the overly simplified "American Skin", Mr. Springsteen has expressed himself nobly but, in my view, narrowly, to one set of Americans who share his political ideology.

Despite this, I still listen.
