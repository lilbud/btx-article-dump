A prime topic after Bruce Springsteen's tour-opening show at the Worcester Centrum Thursday was the conspicuous lack of some of his most famous songs.

Those included two of his best-known '70s anthems, "Badlands" and "Thunder Road." The latter he once even dubbed his "birth song" and was often used to open concerts at that time.

"He's dropped a lot of the old warhorses", Springsteen's biographer, Dave Marsh, said at a post-show press reception Thursday. "He's felt it's time he put them away. He's wondered if people would let him, but he just felt it was time."

Springsteen didn't show up at the reception -- attended by a few dozen music writers from around the country -- but several members of his E Street Band did. Drummer Max Weinberg revealed how serious Springsteen has been about this new tour. "We rehearsed for six weeks -- that's the longest time we've ever taken", Weinberg said. "The last time out, for the 'Born in the U.S.A.' tour, I think we rehearsed about a week."

Weinberg also thought the tour would continue well beyond the month-and-a-half for which it's now booked. "A production like this just has to", he said.

Incidentally, the Boston Garden is still hoping to book Springsteen later in the tour. New Garden
