WORCESTER - What a relief Bruce Springsteen must have experienced last night.

After being hounded at his hotel and tracked around town by relentless hordes of media in recent days, he finally got a chance to do what he came to New England for -- play music.

And what an unusual night of music it was.

Kicking off his celebrity straitjacket, Springsteen tried to reinvent himself, as they say in the music business.

He played many obscure songs from his repertoire, refusing to give the 13,000 sellout fans a batch of easily digested hits and anthems.

Springsteen made the audience think, not just boogie. But he had fun doing it, even sprinkling in bits of tongue-in-cheek cabaret for the first time in his career. That seemed another attempt to defuse his star status -- and ask the crowd not to view him so reverently.

Last night's show, which began his first national tour in three years, started off with an unself-conscious, carnival theme. Springsteen and his entire E Street Band -- 7 regular members and the specially added five-piece La Bamba horns from New Jersey -- came out and sheepishly, like eternal teen-agers, pretended to buy tickets from a tuxedoed carny barker at a counter marked "Tunnel of Love Express Tour", adapted from the name of his latest album.

Springsteen added to the theatrical element by being dressed in a white shirt, cream-colored vest, black pants and pointy black shoes that gave him the air of a boardwalk sharpie on the make.

The first set, 75 minutes long, included no fewer than five songs from the "Tunnel of Love" album, which hasn't done astonishingly well on the charts, resting currently at No. 15 on Billboard magazine's Top Pop 100 -- below albums by the likes of Belinda Carlisle, Debbie Gibson and Tiffany.

But unlike Springsteen's last record, "Born in the U.S.A.", the album's softer moods weren't designed to crest the charts, so one has to admire his adherence to these songs in concert. He clearly doesn't want to sell his soul for the stadium success of the last tour -- and indeed, only did two songs, "Cover Me"

and the set-ending title track, from his "Born in the U.S.A." disk.

Also surprising was the number of obscure B-sides -- four of them -- which he played during the night. Even diehard fanatics were shaking their heads over a few of them, including "I'll Be True", "Roulette" and "Coward." Springsteen was asking to be judged as a true songwriter, not just an automatic hitmaker.

As always, he also came off as a storyteller without peer in the rock industry. If Springsteen ever decides to run for political office -- and don't think there aren't many who would like to see him try -- he could go far with his frank confessions about himself and his folksy, populist style. This time he again told stories of tension with his Freehold, N.J., father -- stories that were a feature of his "River" tour in 1980. He also eloquently told of an abused neighbor who was sweet to him as a child -- and of the regret he had of returning home to that same neighborhood over the years and finding himself a complete stranger to it.

"I felt I had changed. I had become a man, and the people who were kind to me were gone forever. The people in those houses were strangers just like me, doing the best they could to hold onto the things they loved", he said.

He also engaged in more cabaret with saxophonist Clarence Clemons, sitting on a park bench and reminiscing about the old days when they would stare at passing girls and discuss their romantic dreams.

In another cabaret gesture, Springsteen mimicked evangelist Jimmy Swaggart and stomped around stage, shouting "I've got to lay my body down for you tonight, because I have sinned!" Again, he was trying to come off as a flesh-and-blood figure, not a celebrity icon.

Then, of course, he started rocking. The second set built up with some Bo Diddley beats ("She's the One", where Clemons unleashed his sax), some Lloyd Price-style New Orleans music ("You Can Look", where pianist Roy Bittan echoed Jerry Lee Lewis).

But there were still the softer textures woven in, including another "Tunnel of Love" song, "One Step Up" (with a lovely backing vocal from Patty Scialfa, who is much more prominent on this tour) and an acoustic version of Springsteen's epic "Born to Run", which put him on the map in 1975 when Time and Newsweek both ran their famous simultaneous cover stories.

In sum, Springsteen is still the Boss, but a more gentle, ever-more-human boss this trip. His bid to fight his way out of the celebrity straitjacket made us all think a little more deeply last night.
