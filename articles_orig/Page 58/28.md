Bruce mania rushes on. The five-record set, "Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band Live/1975-85", will debut at No. 1 on next week's Billboard pop chart.

The last album to accomplish that was Stevie Wonder's "Songs in the Key of Life" 10 years ago.

About 1.7 million copies of the package were shipped to record stores last week, but Springsteen's label, CBS Records, has already received reorders for 800,000 copies, spokesman Steve Mandel said yesterday.

Radio stations have gone so wild that Billboard had a cover story this week entitled "All-Bruce Radio", pointing out that many rock stations are routinely programming up to 19 of the 40 songs in the package.
