Bruce Springsteen's third album, "Born to Run", should be in the record stores about now and it should be all he needs to push him over the top.

The trouble with Mr. Springsteen's career, as anyone who has followed rock music at all recently already knows, is that his records haven't matched the astonishing impact of his live performances.

The first record, which came out in late 1972, was called "Greetings From Asbury Park, N. J." It's an inconsistent disk, which Mr. Springsteen attributes to the fact that Columbia Records thought of him as a conventional singer-songwriter and thus blunted the rock impact of his style. Even so, with memories of his live performances fresh in one's ears, the best songs ("Growin Up" and "Spirit in the Night", for instance) work wonderfully well.

The second album came out a year later and was entitled "The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle." This is really a great record already, but it's not quite as consistently fine or as consistently rock-oriented as the third. However winning the songs sound, they really function as rough models for the fully formed versions one hears live.

"Born to Run" gets us closer still to what Bruce Springsteen is all about. The range is as wide as either of the earlier albums, from poignancy to street-strutting cockiness to punk poetry to quasi-Broadway to surging rock anthems. But all of it (except "Meeting Across the River", which works superbly on its own terms) is solidly rock 'n' roll.

Mr. Springsteen's gifts are so powerful and so diverse that it's difficult even to try to describe them in a short space. Sometimes his lyrics still lapse too close to selfconscious myth making but generally they epitomize urban folk poetry at its best—overflowing with pungent detail and evocative metaphors, but never tied to their sources in a way that is binding. This is poetry that attains universality through the very sureness of its concrete imagery. And Mr. Springsteen's themes perfectly summarize the rock experience, full of cars and love, street macho and desperate aspiration. Hearing these songs is like hearing your own life in music, even if you never lived in New Jersey or made love under the boardwalk in Asbury Park.

In the first album the music seemed secondary to the words, but in retrospect that seems largely a matter of production. Mr. Springsteen's music is both a compendium of rock influences and absolutely personal. He uses lots of inexorably building repetition, and that was what sounded a little bland on the first album. But properly mixed, as the second and especially the third albums have been, the repetition becomes overwhelming.

And the tunes, the hoarse, fervent singing, the arrangements and their instrumental execution and above all the sheer feeling for what rock is about simply pour out of the speakers. Mr. Springsteen's music is astonishing for many things, perhaps most immediately for its exultant rhythmic energy. In live performance especially, however, he constructs symphonic set pieces out of his songs, knitting together dramatic and musical ideas that amount to a tapestry of American imagery and popular music.

At any given moment the sound stays true to its essential simplicity and directness, even if the textures can approach almost orchestral richness. But the real diversity lies in the many different sorts of popular music that he and his wonderful E Street Band can do so well.

The only nagging question is how this new record is going to sound out in the heartland, where people may have never heard of Bruce Springsteen, or, worse, may think of him as some overhyped Easterner.

All this observer can say is that on repeated hearings and after seeing him perform again this summer, "Born to Run" seems one of the great records of recent years. If Mr. Springsteen has to perform more to get his message across, let him perform away—he seems to enjoy it enough. We're still waiting for the live (double?) album from him that should justify the whole notion of live albums. No doubt he will make still greater studio albums than this someday. But in the meantime, you owe it to yourself to buy this record.
