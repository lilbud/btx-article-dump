Two former roadies who are suing Bruce Springsteen had their day in court yesterday.

Mike Batlan and Doug Sutphin have contended that their old employer illegally refused to pay overtime, arbitrarily docked paychecks and reneged on a promise to Batlan about salary.

Springsteen's attorney, Peter Parcher, noted that roadies, who handle moving duties and odd jobs with rock bands, traditionally never get overtime and that thus there was no reason for Springsteen to pay it. Later, the pair's attorney, Stephen Scheuler, said: "He gets up on stage as the champion of the working man and then he says he's never heard of overtime?"

Lawyers on both sides are filing motions in this 18-month-old case. The case presents two opposite pictures.

The Batlan/Sutphin view begins in 1973, when, they say, Springsteen promised Batlan he would always be paid just slightly less than the band. Batlan wasn't.

After they filed suit, Batlan and Sutphin believe that Springsteen's attorneys dragged their feet long enough to let Springsteen do the "Tunnel of Love" tour without having to pay overtime. Now the lawyers acknowledge that Springsteen is covered by federal wage-and-hour laws, but say that the statute of limitations has expired, meaning Batlan and Sutphin are owed almost nothing.

The Springsteen view: This is basically a nuisance suit. The alleged promise to Batlan was never made. Futhermore, say Springsteen's people, Batlan and Sutphin were very well-paid (in the $50,000 range) for not-very-difficult jobs (equipment maintenance), and their performance was slipping. Still, they say, Springsteen resisted pressure to fire them and tried to shape them up with warnings - and by docking their paychecks. In late 1985, Batlan quit and Sutphin was fired. Springsteen gave Batlan $125,000 and Sutphin $100,000, Parcher says.

Roadies are hired to do a job, not to work specific hours, say Springsteen's lawyers; they know this before they sign on. Furthermore, the lawyers say, many of Springsteen's roadies are paid even when there is no tour, and most stay with him for years, which suggests they feel well-treated.

Scheuler's associate, Larry Jones, says the case will go to trial, possibly as early as July or August. If that's true, Springsteen may do a date on a witness stand.
