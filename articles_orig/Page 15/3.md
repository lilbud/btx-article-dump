BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN & THE E STREET BAND Live in New York City Sony $24.97

If Bruce Springsteen's 1986 five-LP boxed set of live recordings brought down the curtain on the first act of his remarkable career, "Live in New York City" may well mark the opening of the third. Even as this two-disc document from his 1999-2000 reunion tour with the E Street Band hits stores Tuesday, Springsteen and that old gang of his have returned to a New York recording studio to cut new songs and move forward into the future together again.

The reunion tour with the E Street Band was not just a simple celebration of glory days, a nostalgic tribute to past triumphs. It was a contemplation on old friends and the ties that bind. The opening salvo of "My Love Will Not Let You Down" and "Prove It All Night" set that stage, as Springsteen and company rummage through fresh corners of their songbook and reconnect in new and exciting ways. They draw enormous strength from one another, from being together as a band again, and that swagger spills out of the speakers on the new record.

The first 13 songs of the 19-song collection serve as the soundtrack to an HBO concert documentary that airs at 9 p.m. Saturday. The first disc builds through the rousing opening, past a swelling "Atlantic City", through the elegiac "Mansion on the Hill" (with Springsteen and his wife, Patti Scialfa, gently yodeling the song to a close) and into an extended, doleful "The River. " As the set careens toward a finish through a blistering "Youngstown", "Murder Incorporated", "Badlands" and into the jubilant "Out in the Street", the record moves steadily toward its first explosive, cathartic climax.

A 16-minute version of "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out", where Springsteen runs through a lengthy, showy set of band introductions, leads to the set's second climax, a one-two punch of previously unrecorded new songs -- "Land of Hope and Dreams" and "American Skin (41 Shots)." The juxtaposition of these two songs, the closing numbers on the HBO broadcast, offers both sides of the American dream. While "Land of Hope and Dreams", a train song in the classic tradition, revels in the great possibilities of life, "American Skin" is the dark, bitter reality.

The latter, which stirred controversy last year when an unofficial live version first hit the Internet, refers to the case of Amadou Diallo, a black man shot to death in the Bronx by four plainclothes police officers who mistook him for a rape suspect. When Diallo reached into his pocket to produce his wallet and identification, the police opened fire, pumping 41 bullets into his body. All four were acquitted of all charges.

Every song is an epic. All the pieces are fat, with long, rich instrumental passages, crescendos and crashing waves of big rock sound. This kind of extravagant bombast may sound great in a concert hall, but it can wear thin at home. Saxophonist Clarence Clemons seems to play the same solo over and over. But the vitality and joy that these nine musicians share is a palpable part of the production. Let's call it a bookmark and eagerly await the next chapter.
