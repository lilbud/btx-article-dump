Bruce Springsteen
Darkness on the Edge of Town
Columbia 35318
Released: June 1978
Chart Peak: #5
Weeks Charted: 83
Certified 2x Platinum: 7/6/89

On this long awaited effort, Springsteen eschews the tight dense sound of his acclaimed "Born To Run" to put the emphasis on his unique throaty singing style. While more sparse, the music is equally powerful, with the seven-man band behind Springsteen aided by the studio prowess of the producers along with Steve Van Zandt, Jimmy Iovine and Charles Plotkin. Springsteen's lyrics continue their exploration of doom and adolescent angst as perceived is small New Jersey towns. This is the type of album that grows with each listening. Best cuts: "Adam Raised Cain", "Factory", "Prove It All Night", "Darkness On The Edge Of Town."
