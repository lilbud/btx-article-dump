A near three-year gap separates Darkness On The Edge Of Town and its predecessor, the star-confirming Born To Run, a delay caused by Springsteen's acrimonious lawsuit against his former manager, but in that time he had clearly lost none of his energy and ability to encapsulate the American blue- collar experience. Eleven months in the making, sales for the album did not match its predecessor's sales of six million; however, it managed Number Five on the Hot 100 chart in the US, while actually bettering Born To Run's showing in the UK, peaking at Number 16.

Darkness On The Edge Of Town was intended by Springsteen to be a more sparse record than his previous album, but it sounds just as powerful. "I just had a specific thing in mind", Springsteen explained later, "It had to be relentless." A lot has been made of the creative influence wielded by producer -- and later to become Springsteen's manager -- Jon Landau, who is said to have guided the singer/songwriter back towards a more stripped-down sound, with songs averaging four minutes in length, and certainly the album's overall brevity is a new departure, albeit that "Racing In The Street" was a portent of things to follow on his follow-up, The River.

As of 2004, Darkness On The Edge Of Town was the #67 best-selling album of the 70s.
