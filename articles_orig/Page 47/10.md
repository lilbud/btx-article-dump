Up close and personal: Bruce Springsteen has said of his upcoming Australian tour that there will still be an element of surprise.

Back in Australia less than a year after his Wrecking Ball tour smashed the country, Bruce Springsteen has assured fans he hasn't just returned to visit places he missed, he's here to keep surprising his audience.

Speaking on stage in Perth after a media-exclusive sound check of Dream Baby Dream, Springsteen said that even the fans that followed him across Australia in 2013 would be kept guessing and that no night would ever be the same.

"I don't have any approach to it except to keep changing it up."

"And even if you've seen many, many of the shows, there's going to be a moment when I surprise you, which is what I try to do."

The band played the Suicide's cover, recently released on new album High Hopes.

When asked if he was planning any more Australian covers after also releasing a version of The Saints' Just Like Fire Would, which first featured on the Wrecking Ball tour in Brisbane, Springsteen said he didn't know. He even took suggestions for which Aussie song to consider.

Springsteen also said the release of High Hopes before the tour meant that he wasn't sure if any Australian or New Zealand audiences would hear a full album played like a few European shows had last year.

"I don't know, I pull that out once in a while ... but we have some new stuff and I still feel like we have a fresh audience for it, that we're gonna keep changing it up every night."

Also back on stage is long-time friend and E Street guitarist Stevie Van Zandt, whose filming commitments meant he was replaced for the Australia tour with Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine.

It was Morello's addition to the band and his fresh approach to some of Springsteen's tracks that led to the release of High Hopes, a collection of reworked tracks, covers and older songs recorded with late E Street alumni Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons.

On his first ever concert in Western Australia, Springsteen said the $550 million Perth Arena narrowly missed out on the last tour.

"I took so long to come to Perth ... because Perth is so very far away."

This time Perth welcomes Springsteen and The E Street Band for three sold-out shows before they travel to Adelaide, another city eagerly awaiting The Boss' debut after more than 40 years in the music industry.

"This is a six-week tour", he said.

"I haven't done a six-week tour since ... I'd have to go back to my 30s. This is the longest stretch away from home ... for 20 years."

After return visits to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, with a weekend stop in the Hunter Valley, the tour moves to New Zealand for two dates at Auckland's Mt Smart Stadium.
