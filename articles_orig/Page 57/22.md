It's not like The Boss and I are tight. But when you use the same bench press and sit at the same Nautilus machines, well, you can't help but share some sweat, you know?

For 20 minutes I moved from bench press to dumbbells to Nautilus, trying to economize my workout and make it back to the newspaper from the Boston Athletic Club in less than an hour. The half-dozen people in the room, all dressed in sweats or shorts and T-shirts, paid little attention to each other, as usual. A workout is a workout.

But there was this guy...

He kind of looked like Bruce Springsteen, you know? Kind of like a regular guy, but something special about him, too.

I shrugged it off until the radio station playing blared THE BOSS ...THE CENTRUM ...WIN SOME TICKETS! and this guy strolled out of the room for a minute. Was that a slight wince I saw as he heard the ad?

I checked the profile again out of the corner of my eye as I pressed 25 pounds on the arm cross. The face sure looked like The Boss, but who can see the celebrity for the sweat clothes?

Finally, I realized I had been 20 minutes in a fog. People started exchanging knowing glances, a kid showed up with an autograph book and a couple of gawkers stood at the door.

My casual glances were becoming direct stares, so I figured, what the heck? I gave up on the tricep machine and wandered over to The Boss, only after noticing that his large, muscular companion had left his side briefly.

I would like to say I had some smooth line like on those commercials you see where people are so cool while working out, but all I could come up with was an "Excuse me, hi."

He said hi back. He shook my hand. His black leather lifting glove against my sweaty palm. I was cruising now.

"So it must be hard to work out when you're on the road, huh?" I asked. Real original.

"Yeah, I just try to find gyms to work out at wherever I go. It's not too hard." The muscleman with him was not exactly a trainer, he said, but just "one of the guys with the band."

But when I identified myself as a reporter, he cringed and said, "Oh, no", and when I tried to keep the conversation going, he was on his guard. "Are we just talking, or is this an interview?"

I let The Boss go back to his bench press and dumbbells.

Patrice Cunniff, a manager at the club, later said that one of Springsteen's bodyguard's had come in to look around and tour the club, then returned with The Boss and another bodyguard.

"They each paid the guest fee, which is $12 for guests in some Boston hotels"said Cunniff, who said she was reluctant to talk about the visit after the hubbub it had created.

Indeed, things were calm when I worked out, but as I did my final set of sit- ups and left the room, I noticed more people -- not dressed in sweats -- coming in to catch a glimpse.

"We tried to diminish it, but what happens is, one person makes the initial breakthrough, then others start going up to him."

Gee, who could that have been?

All I know is, he walks, he talks, he sweats and no, he did not offer me any tickets.
