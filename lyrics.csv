Now I remember, my first love (I remember)
Of course the whole thing went wrong (I remember)

I woke up feeling the sunshine
Drift across my face
It took me back to emotions
From another time and place
Those yesterdays
Cruising in my Chevrolet
I held my baby in my arms
But my first love was always those songs

[Chorus]
I'm talkin' 'bout soul days
Talkin' about those sweet soul days

[Verse 2]
I crawled out of bed real slowly
Threw on some old blue jeans
I found my favorite T-shirt
And started rollin' up my sleeves
Like James Dean
Thinkin' I was still nineteen
I walked outside and looked around
My heart was pumping when I found

It's gonna be a soul day
I laid back sunning
Sweet summer soul days

I think I'll take my baby for a ride
Down to the back road
Out in the country
Where the summer winds blow
Over by the river
There's a barbecue shack
Otis on the jukebox
You know I like it like that, yeah

[Chorus]
Soul days
Dancin' with my baby
Swayin' to the sweet soul days

[Verse 3]
And when the sun goes down
And we're on the road again
Those white lines runnin' down the highway
Slowly reelin' us in
With the radio on
Swinging to the sweet soul songs
And the music's playin' through the night
Takin' us back to when everything was alright

[Chorus]
Soul days
Talkin' about those sweet summer soul days
I'm talkin' 'bout soul days
I'm going back to the sweet summer soul days

Janey needs a shooter now

[Verse 2]
Well Janey's got a priest, from his marble pulpit he smiles
He provides consolation and he hears her confession at any time
In the pages of his Bible, he holds from what Janey hides
And with her doors open wide, she begs, ""Come inside""
But he's been frozen so long on the outside

Well, Janey's got a cop who lives around the block and checks on her every night
And her skin would turn pale as the siren he'd wail outside
When he knew I was inside
Janey's small and sometimes he scared her
So I held her real close, she was more saint than a ghost
And told her I so long had been prepared for her

There's a girl over by the water fountain
And she's asking to be mine

Those empty streets, no one around
You fall in love with lonely, you end up that way

Rustlin' sheets, a sleepy corner room
Into the musty smell
Of wilted flowers and lazy afternoon hours

Now the pool's filled with empty, eight foot deep
Got dandelions growin' up through the cracks in the concrete

Your lipstick taste and your whispered secret
I promised I'd never tell
A half-drunk beer and your breath in my ear

Well then, it's bills and kids and kids and bills
And the ringing of the bell
Across the valley floor through the dusty screen door

Last night I dreamed of you, my lover
And the wind blew through the window and blew off the covers
Of my lonely bed, I woke to something you said
That it's better to have loved, yeah, it's better to have loved
As I drove, there was a chill in the breeze
And leaves tumbled from the sky and fell
On a road so black as I backtracked

She was boarded up and gone like an old summer song
Nothing but an empty shell

And built me an ark of gopherwood and pitch
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain

Down into the valley where the beast has his throne

Now get yourself a song to sing and sing it till you’re done
Sing it hard and sing it well
Send the robber barons straight to hell
The greedy thieves who came around
And ate the flesh of everything they found
Whose crimes have gone unpunished now
Who walk the streets as free men now

Where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes

Now, when all this steel and these stories
Drift away to rust
And all our youth and beauty
Has been given to the dust
When the game has been decided
And we're burnin’ down the clock
And all our little victories and glories
Have turned into parking lots
When your best hopes and desires
Are scattered to the wind

There's a slip of blood on a silver knife
There's a graveyard kid down below

And you explain there's other boys out there
You complain my car makes too much noise

And where he went, women wept and men died

He cocked his pistol, pulled the trigger, and shouted, ""Let it stop!""

Some say they remain frozen high upon that icy ledge

Where have you gone my handsome Billy?

Sundown, sundown
The carnival train's leaving town
Where are you now my darling Billy?

[Verse 1]
We won't be dancing together on the high wire
Facing the lions with you at my side anymore
We won't be breathing the smoke in the fire
On a midway

Hanging from the trapeze, my wrists waiting for your wrists
Two daredevils high upon the wall of death
You throwing the knife that lands inches from my heart
Sundown

Moon rise, moon rise, the light that was in your eyes is gone away
Daybreak, daybreak, the thing in you that made me ache has gone to stay

We'll be riding the train without you tonight
The train that keeps on moving
Its black smoke scorching the evening sky
A million stars shining above us like every soul living and dead
Has been gathered together by God to sing a hymn
Over your bones

A little piece of steel
And cried, ""Hammer's going to
Be death of me, Lord, Lord

Now the captain he
Said to John Henry
""I'm going to bring that
Steam drill around
I'm going to bring that
Steam drill out on these tracks
I'm going to knock that
Steel on down, God, God
I'm going to knock that

""Lord, a man is nothing but a man
But before I let that steam drill
Beat me down
I'm going to die with a hammer
In my hand, Lord, Lord
I'll die with a hammer in my hand""

""Shaker, why don't you sing?
Because I'm swinging thirty pounds
From my hips on down
Yeah, listen to my cold steel
Ring, Lord Lord
Listen to my cold steel ring""

In the mountains

But he worked so hard
It broke his heart
John Henry laid down his hammer
And died, Lord, Lord

He had him a woman
By the name of Polly Ann

With the whole world looking on
I know what it's like to have soared
And come crashin' like a drunk on a barroom floor

Now you've got no reason to trust me
My confidence is a little rusty
But if you don't feel like being alone
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

Well now our old fears and failures, oh baby, they do linger
Like the shadow of that ring that was on your finger
Those days, they've come and gone
Baby, I could walk you all the way home

She said, ""Honey, how's that feel
Do you want me to go slow?""

Rainey William's playground was the Mott Haven streets
Where he ran past melted candles and flower wreaths
Names and photos of the young black faces
Whose death and blood consecrated these places

[Verse 2]
Rainey's mother said, ""Rainey, stay at my side
For you are my blessing, you are my pride
It's your love here that keeps my soul alive
I want you to come home from school and stay inside""

Rainey'd do his work and put his books away
There was a channel showed a western movie every day
Lynette brought him home books on the Black cowboys of the Oklahoma range
The Seminole scouts that fought the tribes of the Great Plains

Summer come and the days grew long
Rainey always had his mother's smile to depend on
Along the street of stray bullets, he made his way
To the warmth of her arms at the end of each day

[Verse 5]
Come the fall, the rain flooded these homes
Here in Ezekiel's valley of dry bones
It fell hard and dark to the ground
It fell without a sound

[Verse 6]
Lynette took up with a man whose business was the boulevard
Whose smile was fixed in a face that was never off guard
In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink, his secrets are kept
In the day, behind drawn curtains in Lynette's bedroom, he slept

[Verse 7]
Then she got lost in the days
The smile Rainey depended on dusted away
The arms that held him were no more his home
He lay at night his head pressed to her chest listening to the ghost in her bones

[Verse 8]
In the kitchen, Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes
From a brown bag pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side
Stood in the dark at his mother's bed
Brushed her hair and kissed her eyes

[Verse 9]
In the twilight, Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone
Through Pennsylvania and Ohio, his train drifted on
Through the small towns of Indiana, the big train crept
As he lay his head back on the seat and slept

He woke and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green

She came out of the Guadalupe's on a night so cold
Her coat was frosted diamonds in the sallow moon's glow

Sixteen hands from her withers to the ground
I lie in bed and listen to the sound
Of the west Texas thunder roll

I track her into the mountains she loved
Watch her from the rocks above
She'd dip her neck and drink from the winter flows

But they could never lay a rope on her
No corral will ever hold

Over the pradera low and wide

I fought champion Jack Thompson in a field full of mud
Rain poured through the tent to the canvas and mixed with our blood

Until I felt my glove leather slip between his skin and bone

And the women and the money came fast and the days I lost track

From high in the rafters, I watched myself fall

Now the gray rain is falling and my ring fighting done
So in the work fields and alleys, I take all who'll come

And show me your money and speak out your crime

Late that summer, I was rolling through the plains of Texas
A vision passed before my eyes
A small house sitting track-side
With the glow of the savior's beautiful light

[Verse 8]
A woman stood cooking in the kitchen
Kid sat at a table with his old man
Now I wonder, does my son miss me
Does he wonder where I am?

[Verse 9]
Tonight I pick my campsite carefully
Outside the Sacramento yard
Gather some wood and light a fire
In the early winter dark

[Verse 10]
Wind whistling cold, I pull my coat around me
Heat some coffee and stare into the black night
I lie awake, I lie awake, sir
With my machete by my side

Somewhere across the border

We'll leave behind, my dear, the pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy waters
Where the sky grows gray and wide, we'll meet on the other side
There across the border

For you, I'll build a house high upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory, pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border

Sweet blossoms fill the air, pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool, clear waters
And in your arms 'neath open skies, I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes

And tomorrow my heart will be strong
May the saints' blessings and grace carry me safely into your arms

That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters?

For fifteen years, Le Bin Son
Fought side by side with the Americans
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam
In '75, Saigon fell and he left his command
And brought his family to the promised land

[Verse 2]
Seabrook, Texas and the small towns in the Gulf of Mexico
It was delta country and reminded him of home
He worked as a machinist, put his money away
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin
And together, they harvested Galveston Bay

In the morning before the sun come up
He'd kiss his sleeping daughter
And steer out through the channel
Cast his nets into the water

Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company
In the highlands of Quang Tri
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai
Shipped home in '68

There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds
In a boat that'd been his father's
In the morning, he'd kiss his sleeping son
Cast his nets into the water

Billy sat in front of his TV as the South fell
And the communists rolled into Saigon
He and his friends watched as the refugees came
Settled on the same streets and worked the coast they'd grew up on

Soon in the bars 'round the harbor
There was talk of ""America for Americans""
Someone said ""You want 'em out, you got to burn 'em out""
And brought in the Texas Klan

[Verse 6]
One humid Texas night
There were three shadows on the harbor
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea
In the fire's light, shots rang out
Two Texans lay dead on the ground
Le stood with a pistol in his hand
[Chorus]
A jury acquitted him in self-defense
As before the judge he did stand
But as Le walked down the courthouse steps
Billy said, ""My friend, you're a dead man""

[Verse 7]
One late summer night
Le stood watch along the waterside
Billy stood in the shadows
His Ka-Bar knife in his hand

[Verse 8]
And the moon slipped behind the clouds
Le lit a cigarette, the bay was still as glass
As he walked by, Billy stuck his knife into his pocket
Took a breath and let him pass

In the early darkness, Billy rose up
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water
Kissed his sleeping wife, headed into the channel

I was just kinda killin' time
When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting

I fell in love with beautiful Doreen
She was the prettiest thing this old town'd ever seen
I courted her and I made her mine
But I grew jealous whenever another man come walkin' down the line

[Verse 4]
And my jealousy made me treat her mean and cruel
She sighed, ""Bobby, oh Bobby, you're such a fool
Don't you know before you choose your wish, you'd better think first?
'Cause with every wish, there comes a curse""

These days I sit around and laugh at the many rivers I've crossed
But on the far banks, there's always another forest where a man can get lost
Well, there in the high trees, love's bluebird glides
Guiding us 'cross to another river on the other side

And there, someone is waitin' with a look in her eyes
And though my heart's grown weary and more than a little bit shy
Tonight I'll drink from her waters to quench my thirst

He walked lookin' over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code
When something caught his eye, he'd measure his need
And then very carefully he'd proceed

Billy met a young girl in the early days of May
It was there in her arms, he let his cautiousness slip away
In their lovers' twilight as the evening sky grew dim

On his right hand, Billy'd tattooed the word ""love"" and on his left hand was the word ""fear""

And with his own hands built her a great house down by the riverside

Now Billy was an honest man, he wanted to do what was right
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving night
Alone on his knees in the darkness, for steadiness he'd pray
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay

She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep a thousand miles away

I knew some day your runnin' would be through
And you'd think back on me and you
And your love would be strong
You'd forget all about the bad
And think only of all the laughs that we had

I'm driving a big, lazy car
Rushin' up the highway in the dark

And one hand's tremblin' over my heart
It's pounding, baby, like it's gonna bust right on through
And it ain't gonna stop till I'm alone again with you

A friend of mine became a father last night
When we spoke, in his voice, I could hear the light
Of the skies and the rivers, the timberwolf in the pines
And that great jukebox out on Route 39
They say he travels fastest who travels alone
But tonight I miss my girl, mister, tonight I miss my home

Is it the sound of the leaves left blown by the wayside
That's got me out here on this spooky old highway tonight?
Is it the cry of the river with the moonlight shining through?
That ain't what scares me, baby, what scares me is losin' you

They say if you die in your dreams, you really die in your bed
But, honey, last night I dreamed my eyes rolled straight back in my head
And God's light came shinin' on through
I woke up in the darkness scared and breathin' and born anew
It wasn't the cold river bottom I felt rushing over me
It wasn't the bitterness of a dream that didn't come true
It wasn't the wind in the grey fields I felt rushing through my arms

Look up at that mansion on the hill

In the summer, all the lights would shine
There'd be music playing, people laughing all the time
Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill

I watch the cars rushing by, far from the mill

Well, they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late last month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job, but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin' Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun, shot a night clerk, now they call him Johnny 99

[Verse 2]
Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light, you don't stop
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an off-duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club TipTop, they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99

[Verse 3]
Well, the city supplied a public defender, but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down
""Well, the evidence is clear, gonna let the sentence, son, fit the crime
Prison for ninety-eight and a year and we'll call it even, Johnny 99""

[Verse 4]
A fistfight broke out in the courtroom, they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted, ""Judge, don't take my boy this way""
""Well, son, you got any statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away?""

[Verse 5]
""Now, judge, judge, I got debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that made me an innocent man
But it was more than all this that put that gun in my hand

[Verse 6]
Well, your honor, I do believe I'd be better off dead
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over, judge, one more time?
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line""",Nebraska,1982,Johnny 99

It's been the same comedown

Frankie's in trouble downtown
Well, if it was any other man
I'd put him straight away
But when it's your brother
Sometimes you look the other way

Well, Frankie went in the army
Back in 1965

Settled down, took Maria for my wife

Well, the night was like any other
I got a call 'bout quarter to nine
There was trouble in a roadhouse
Out on the Michigan line
There was a kid lying on the floor, looking bad
Bleeding hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table
And it was Frank, they said

Well, I went out and I jumped in my car
And I hit the lights
Well, I must've done a hundred and ten
Through Michigan County that night
It was out at the crossroads
Down 'round Willow Bank
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates
Behind the wheel was Frank
Well, I chased him through them county roads
'Til a sign said ""Canadian border, five miles from here""
I pulled over on the side of the highway
And watched his taillights disappear

And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path

I broke through the trees and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran 'til I fell shaking in his arms

I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed and to that house, I did ride
From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light

I walked up the steps and stood on the porch

I told her my story and who I'd come for
She said ""I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore""

I see you walking, baby, down the street
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet
I see that lonely ribbon in your hair
Tell me, am I the man for whom you put it there?
You never smile, girl, you never speak
You just walk on by, darling, week after week
Raising two kids alone in this mixed-up world
Must be a lonely life for a working girl

Little girl, I wanna marry you
Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you
Yes I do, little girl, I wanna marry you

[Verse 2]
Now, honey, I don't wanna clip your wings
But a time comes when two people should think of these things
Having a home and a family
Facing up to their responsibilities
They say in the end, true love prevails
But in the end, true love can't be some fairytale
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong
But maybe, darling, I could help them along

Oh yeah, little girl, I wanna marry you

That true, true love was just a lie
He went to his grave a broken heart

I come from down in the valley
Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do
Like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd drive out of this valley
Down to where the fields were green

[Chorus 1]
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

[Verse 2]
Then I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday
I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride

I got a job working construction
For the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work
On account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well, mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
And Mary acts like she don't care

[Verse 4]
But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks, I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true?
Or is it something worse?

That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight

You grew up where young girls, they grow up fast
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked
But what they asked, baby, wasn't right

Once I dreamed we were together again
Baby, you and me
Back home in those old clubs
The way we used to be
We were standing at the bar and it was hard to hear
The band was playing loud and you were shouting something in my ear
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor

[Verse 4]
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancing slow
And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go
Well, I saw you last night down on the avenue
Your face was in the shadows, but I knew that it was you
You were standing in the doorway out of the rain
You didn't answer when I called out your name
You just turned, and then you looked away
Like just another stranger waiting to get blown away

Point blank
Right between the eyes
Whoa (Baby), point blank
Right between the pretty lies
You fell, point blank
Shot straight through the heart
Yeah, point blank

That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep

When our love was young and bold

Out on to an open road, you ride until the day
You learn to sleep at night with the price you pay

Now with their hands held high, they reached out for the open skies
And in one last breath, they built the roads they'd ride to their death
Driving on through the night, unable to break away

[Verse 3]
I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A
I blew that Camaro off my back
And drove that little girl away

But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home, the house is dark
She sighs, ""Baby, did you make it all right?""

She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born

For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me, we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
[Chorus]
Tonight, tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way, mister, you best keep
'Cause summer's here and the time is right

On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
I pick up my money and head back into town
Driving 'cross the Waynesboro county line
I got the radio on and I'm just killing time

Working all day in my daddy's garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon, little girl, I'm gonna take charge

I get up every morning and go to work each day
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Sometimes I feel so weak, I just wanna explode

Explode and tear this whole town apart
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart

Gonna be a twister to blow everything down

Blow away the dreams that break your heart
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing

Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes
Man takes his lunch, walks out in the morning light

He said, ""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""

I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""

Catlong sighs holding Kitty's black tooth
She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth
And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley
Since Kitty left with Big Pretty things have got pretty thin, yeah yeah
It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are muscling in

[Verse 2]
Well Jack Knife cries 'cause baby's in a bundle
She goes running nightly, lightly through the jungle
And them tin cans are exploding out in the ninety-degree heat
Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street
It's sad but it sure is true
Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Catlong lies back bent on a trash can
Flashing lights cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man
Well you better learn to move fast when you're young or you're not long around
Cat somehow lost his Kitty down in the city pound
So get right, get tight, get down
Well who's that down at the end of the alley?
She's been gone so long
(Here she comes, here she comes)
(Here she comes, here she comes)
(Here she comes, here she comes)
(Here she comes, here she comes)

Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)

Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Oh, Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)
Kitty's back in town (Here she comes now)
Kitty's back in town (Oh-oh all right)

[Verse 4]
Now Cat knows his Kitty's been untrue
And that she left him for a city dude
But she's so soft, she's so blue
When he looks into her eyes
He just sits back and sighs
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?
Ooh, what can I do? Ooh, what can I do?

[Verse 1]
The machinist climbs his ferris wheel like a brave
And the fire eater's lying in a pool of sweat, victim of the heatwave
Behind the tent the hired hand tightens his legs on the sword swallower's blade
And circus town's on the shortwave

[Verse 2]
Well the runway lies ahead like a great false dawn
Whoa, fat lady, big mama, Missy Bimbo sits in her chair and yawns
And the man-beast lies in his cage sniffing popcorn
As the midget licks his fingers and suffers Missy Bimbo's scorn
Circus town's been born

[Verse 3]
Whoa, and a press roll drummer go, ballerina to and fro
Cartwheeling up on that tightrope with a cannon blast lightning flash
Moving fast through the tent Mars bent, he's gonna miss his fall
Oh God save the human cannonball
And the flying Zambinis watch Margarita do her neck twist
And the ringmaster gets the crowd to count along: ""Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven""

[Verse 4]
A ragged suitcase in his hand, he steals silently away from the circus grounds
And the highway's haunted by the carnival sounds
They dance like a great greasepaint ghost on the wind
A man in baggy pants, a lonely face, a crazy grin
Running home to some small Ohio town
Jesus send some good women to save all your clowns

[Verse 5]
And circus boy dances like a monkey on barbed wire
And the barker romances with a junkie, she's got a flat tire
And now the elephants dance real funky and the band plays like a jungle fire
Circus town's on the live wire

[Verse 6]
And the strong man Samson lifts the midget little Tiny Tim way up on his shoulders, way up
And carries him on down the midway past the kids, past the sailors
To his dimly lit trailer
And the ferris wheel turns and turns like it ain't ever gonna stop
And the circus boss leans over, whispers into the little boy's ear ""Hey son, you want to try the big top?""
All aboard, Nebraska's our next stop","The Wild, the Innocent & The E Street Shuffle",1973,Wild Billy's Circus Story

Spanish Johnny drove in from the underworld last night
With bruised arms and broken rhythm in a beat-up old Buick
But dressed just like dynamite
He tried selling his heart to the hard girls over on Easy Street
But they sighed, ""Johnny, it falls apart so easy
And you know hearts these days are cheap""

[Verse 2]
And the pimps swung their axes and said
""Johnny, you're a cheater""
Well, the pimps swung their axes and said
""Johnny, you're a liar""
And from out of the shadows came a young girl's voice
Said, ""Johnny, don't cry""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Puerto Rican Jane, oh won't you tell me what's your name
I want to drive you down to the other side of town
Where paradise ain't so crowded
There'll be action going down on Shanty Lane tonight
All them golden-heeled fairies in a real bitch fight
Pull .38s and kiss the girls good night

[Chorus 1]
Oh good night, it's alright, Jane
Now let them black boys in to light the soul flame
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe

[Verse 3]
Well, like a cool Romeo he made his moves
Oh she looked so fine
Like a late Juliet she knew he'd never be true
But then she didn't really mind
Upstairs a band was playing
The singer was singing something about going home
She whispered, ""Spanish Johnny, you can leave me tonight
But just don't leave me alone""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And Johnny cried ""Puerto Rican Jane
Word is down the cops have found the vein""
Oh, them barefoot boys left their homes for the woods
Them little barefoot street boys they say homes ain't no good
They left the corners, threw away all their switchblade knives
And kissed each other good-bye

[Verse 4]
Johnny was sitting on the fire escape
Watching the kids playing down the street
He called down ""Hey little heroes
Summer's long but I guess it ain't very sweet around here anymore""
Janey sleeps in sheets damp with sweat
Johnny sits up alone and watches her dream on, dream on
And the sister prays for lost souls
Then breaks down in the chapel after everyone's gone
Jane moves over to share her pillow
But opens her eyes to see Johnny up and putting his clothes on
[Pre-Chorus 3]
She says ""Those romantic young boys
All they ever want to do is fight""
Those romantic young boys
They're calling through the window
""Hey Spanish Johnny, you want to make a little easy money tonight?""

[Chorus 2]
And Johnny whispered, ""Good night, it's all tight, Jane
I'll meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
We may find it out on the street tonight, baby
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe

[Chorus 3]
Ah, good night, it's all right, Jane
I'm gonna meet you tomorrow night on Lover's Lane
Ah, we can find it out on the street tonight, baby
Or we may walk until the daylight, maybe

Spread out now, Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up Little Dynamite, I'm gonna pick up Little Gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft sweet little girl's tongue
Ah, Rosie, you're the one

[Verse 2]
Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little Gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's, tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us

Now, I know your mama, she don't like me cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand

I'm coming to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't (have any money)
Whoa, your papa says he knows (that I don't have any money)
Whoa, so your daddy says he knows I don't have (Papa says he knows that I don't have any money)
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance

And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, I'm stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California down San Diego way
There's a little café where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear 'em in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, cause don't you know daddy's comin'

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat

With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground

Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, ""Daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band""

And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance

Suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair 'til it was just right

I was open to pain and crossed by the rain
And I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone
And came out with my soul untouched

The flag of piracy flew from my mast
My sails were set wing to wing

Well, I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing
The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order

They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception
And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood

He rides headfirst into a hurricane and disappears into a point

Wieldin' love as a lethal weapon, on his way to hubcap heaven
Baseball cards poked in his spokes, his boots in oil he's patiently soaked

In Volkswagen vans with full running boards
Dragging great anchors, followin' dead-end signs into the sores

Oh, reveal yourself all now to me girl while you've got the strength to speak
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks
But I could give it all to you now if only you could ask
Oh, and don't call for your surgeon even he says it's too late
It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate
Don't give me money, honey, I don't want it back
You and your pony face and your union jack
Well take your local joker and teach him how to act
I swear I was never that way even when I really cracked
Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive
You could laugh and cry in a single sound, oh, right

You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach
And the band they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek?
Yeah, they ragged, jagged melody she still clings to me like a leech
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore
So you, left to find a better reason than the one we were living for
And it's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?
And you should know that's true...

Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right

Together we moved like spirits in the night (All night), in the night (All night)

I had skin like leather and the diamond-hard look of a cobra
I was born blue and weathered but I burst just like a supernova
I could walk like Brando right into the sun
Then dance just like a Casanova
With my blackjack and jacket and hair slicked sweet
Silver star studs on my duds like a Harley in heat
When I strut down the street I could feel its heartbeat
The sisters fell back and said ""Don't that man look pretty""
The cripple on the corner cried out ""Nickels for your pity""
Them gasoline boys downtown sure talk gritty
It's so hard to be a saint in the city
I was the king of the alley, mama, I could talk some trash
I was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar's bash
I was the pimp's main prophet I kept everything cool
Just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose
And when the heat came down it was left on the ground
The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street
Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat
I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat
It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street
And the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead
As the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead
They ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread
But it's too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat
You get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat
Your heart starts beatin' faster as you struggle to your feet

The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming
Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving
No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing
The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the border
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order
But I was not born to live to die, and you were not born for queenin'
It's not too late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'

Mary, Queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'

Mary Lou, that'd only serve to hurt and make you cry like you do

[Verse 2]
You've seen all the romantic movies, you dream and take the boys home
But when the action fades you're left all alone
You deserve better than this, a real love that can grow
And I ain't playin' outtakes, girl, from some late late show, no

[Chorus]
Oh, Mary Lou, you're not like all those others girls
Mary Lou, so afraid to shake up that neat little world (Go, Big Man)

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
Every night you go out looking for true love and satisfaction
But you always end up settling for just lights, camera, action
And another cameo role with some bit player you're befriending
You're gonna go broken-hearted looking for that happy ending
[Chorus]
Mary Lou, I've seen all those movies too
Mary Lou, and I know the hurt too much dreaming can do
Mary Lou, you're gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold
Mary Lou, crying alone in the theatre as the credits roll (Let's go)",Tracks,1998,Mary Lou

I met a little girl and I settled down
In a little house out on the edge of town
We got married and swore we'd never part
Then little by little we drifted from each other's hearts

[Verse 2]
At first I thought it was just restlessness
That would fade as time went by and our love grew deep
In the end it was something more, I guess
That tore us apart and made us weep

[Chorus 1]
And I'm driving a stolen car down on Eldridge Avenue
Each night I wait to get caught, but I never do

[Verse 3]
She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote
When our love was young and bold
She said last night she read those letters
And they made her feel one hundred years old

[Chorus 2]
I'm driving a stolen car on a pitch-black night
And I'm telling myself I'm gonna be alright
But I ride by night and I travel in fear
That in this darkness, I will disappear",Tracks,1998,Stolen Car

And put her little boy on a Greyhound bus
Leaving Memphis with a guitar in his hand
On a one-way ticket to the promised land

There's a party tonight down in Memphis town
I'll be going down there if you need a ride

We drove down into Memphis, the sky was hard and black
Up over the ridge came a white Cadillac
They'd drawn out all his money and they laid him in the back

In a corner in the dark

Well, she called up her mama
To make sure the kids were out of the house
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror
And undid an extra button on her blouse

Man at the top says it's lonely up there
If it is, man, I don't care
From the big White House to the parking lot
Everybody wants to be the man at the top

[Verse 3]
Here comes a banker, here comes a businessman
Here comes a kid with a guitar in his hand
Dreamin' of his record in the number-one spot
Everybody wants to be the man at the top

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to be the man at the top
Everybody wants to be the man at the top now
Aim your gun, son, and shoot your shot
Everybody wants to be the man at the top, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh alright
Oh yeah (Alright now)
Oh alright (Ah)
Oh yeah (Who's the man at the top?)

Well now, you may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby, you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby, I'll spill the facts
Well honey, it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that

[Chorus]
I love you for your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac

[Verse 2]
Well now, way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasure
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man, I ain't going for that
[Chorus]
I know it was her pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac

[Verse 3]
Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man, there's only one thing
And one car that'll do
Anyway, we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back

[Chorus]
And have a party in your pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, feeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in the back
Of your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac

It's one for the money and one for the show
I got one kiss for you, honey, so come on, let's go
I didn't see it coming, but girl, now I know
It takes one for the running but two for the road

[Verse 2]
One thousand dreams whispered in the dark
But a dream's just a dream in one empty heart
It takes more than one to rev it up and go
So let's get it running, we're two for the road

[Bridge]
Two one-way tickets and a diamond ring
Hell, it don't matter what the rain might bring
Oh, when this world treats you hard and cold
I'll stand beside you, we're two for the road

[Verse 3]
When you're alone, my love'll shine the light
Through the dark and starless night
I'll hold you close and never let you go
C'mon now, girl, 'cause we're two for the road
Well, it's two to get ready, babe, c'mon let's go

When you come home late and get undressed (Ah na na na na)
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness

When you need me, call my name
'Cause without you my life just wouldn't be the same
If you want me come sunny skies or rain
When you need me, just call my name

[Verse 2]
If you miss me, well I'll be there
To brush the sunlight from your hair
I'll be there to guide you when trouble walks beside you
If you need me, well I'll be there

And when this dirty world has been cold to you
I got two strong arms waitin' to hold you
And when those mean days come along
We'll stand together and we'll take 'em on
So if you need me, just call my name

Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow
Little boy and his ma shivering outside a rundown music store window
That night on top of a Christmas tree shines one beautiful star
And lying underneath, a brand-new Japanese guitar

[Verse 2]
I remember in the morning, Ma, hearing your alarm clock ring
I'd lie in bed and listen to you gettin' ready for work
The sound of your makeup case on the sink
And the ladies at the office, all lipstick, perfume, and rustlin' skirts
And how proud and happy you always looked walking home from work

[Verse 3]
If Pa's eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true
You couldn't stop me from looking, but you kept me from crawlin' through
And if it's a funny old world, Ma, where a little boy's wishes come true
Well, I got a few left in my pocket and a special one just for you

[Verse 4]
It ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers, or a Mother's Day card
It ain't no house on a hill with a garden and a nice little yard
I got my hot rod down on Bond Street, I'm older
But you'll know me in a glance
We'll find us a little rock 'n roll bar and, baby, we'll go out and dance
(Alright now, c'mon)

[Verse 5]
Well, it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants
Pullin' me up off the couch to do the twist for my uncles and aunts
Well, I found a girl of my own now, Ma
I popped the question on your birthday
She stood waiting on the front porch
While you were telling me to get out there
And say what it was that I had to say

[Verse 6]
Last night we all sat around laughing at the things that guitar bought us
And I layed awake thinking about the other things it's brought us
Well, tonight I'm taking requests here in the kitchen
This one's for you, Ma, let me come right out and say it
It's overdue
But baby, if you're looking for a sad song, well I ain't gonna play it

[Verse 1]
Well, a great black river a man had found
So he put all his money in a hole in the ground
And sent a big steel arm drivin' down, down, down
Man, now I live on the streets of Houston town

[Verse 2]
Packed up my wife and kids when winter came along
And we headed down south with just spit and a song
But they said, ""Sorry, son, it's gone, gone, gone""
Yeah, it's all gone

[Verse 3]
Well, there's men hunkered down by the railroad tracks
The Elkhorn Special blowin' my hair back
Tents pitched on the highway in the dirty moonlight
And I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight

[Verse 4]
Parked in the lumber yard freezin' our asses off
My kids in the back seat got a graveyard cough
Well, I'm sleepin' up in front with my wife
Billy club tappin' on the windshield in the middle of the night
Says, ""Move along man, yeah, move along""

[Verse 5]
Well, big limousine, long, shiny and black
You don't look ahead, you don't look back
How many times can you get up after you've been hit?
Well, I swear if I could spare the spit
I'd lay one on your shiny chrome
And send you on your way back home

[Verse 6]
So if you're gonna leave your town where the north wind blow
To go on down where that sweet soda river flow
Well, you better think twice on it, Jack
You're better off buyin' a shotgun dead off the rack
You ain't gonna find nothin' down here, friend
Except seeds blowin' up the highway in the south wind
Movin' on, yeah, on

I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Oh, brother, are you gonna leave me wastin' away

On the streets of Philadelphia?

[Verse 2]
I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
Just as black and whispering as the rain

On the streets of Philadelphia

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me, brother, with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
