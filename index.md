THE INDEX
In April 2010, " Ain't Got You", started the "Springsteen interview/article
thread" which had about 100 articles some of which, have been transferred to
this thread. Thanks for that. With the help of a lot of people, this Index is
now the most comprehensive source of articles, reviews, interviews, essays and
rants about Bruce Springsteen on the internet.
Looking back on the contents, there is something for everyone here and I am
confident there is nothing like it to be found anywhere else. There are
doctral thesis, more than a hundred contemporaneous newspaper gig reviews plus
almost all of the famous articles spanning Bruce's remarkable career (not all
of them complimentary) and also many, many interviews. There are contributions
from all over the English speaking world but alas, not nearly enough
translations from Europe which would really improve its reach. There are
contributions from Marxists, Darwinists, atheists and people of deep religious
faith. There are pieces by Republicans and Democrats and also by anarchists,
feminists and just plain folk. Four of the articles exceed 70,000 words - in
other words, there is enough here to satisfy all tastes. At the moment, it is
very Bruce- centric and perhaps it should be expanded to cover band members
and influences.

So it's a goodbye from the articles thread. With well over a thousand reviews,
interviews, long and short articles, transcripts and other items, many of
which were found nowhere else, I would like to think it has proved enjoyable
to those who have dipped into it.
I just wish to thank you for all the messages I have received from
journalists, authors ,researchers and others who have told me over the years
and in the past two weeks, how useful they have found it.
Good luck to you all
Beazle
